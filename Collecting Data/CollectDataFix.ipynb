    "The code relies on the following libaries and modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `csv`: Provides functionality for reading and writing CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `request`: This module allows sending HTTP requests and handling responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `os.path`: This module provides functions for working with file paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "- CSV Operations\n",
    "    The code utilizes the `csv` module for CSV file operations, such as reading and writing CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sending HTTP Requests\n",
    "    The code utilizes the `requests` module for sending HTTP requests to retrieve data from external sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Managing File Paths\n",
    "    The code utilizes the `os.path` module for working with file paths, such as checking if a file exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Management\n",
    "    The code utilizes the `time` module for time-related operations, such as pausing the execution for a specified duration.\n",
