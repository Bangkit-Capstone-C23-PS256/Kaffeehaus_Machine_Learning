Cafe Sawah Pujonkidul,ChIJr0WKPtGHeC4Rj4h53gHeeI4,"Kawasan Cafe Sawah, Desa Wisata, Krajan, Pujon Kidul, Kec. Pujon, Kabupaten Malang, Jawa Timur 65391, Indonesia","tourist_attraction, cafe, amusement_park, park, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment",4.5,17274,1.0,"Cafe Sawah Pujon Kidul is one of the cafes located in the Pujon area. This cafe is close to residential areas. Here there are various kinds of food and drinks at low prices. In addition, in this cafe there are also rides for games for children, teenagers and adults. Beautiful scenery and cool weather make people who visit the cafe enjoy the atmosphere there more. The car park here is wide, but tourists who use buses must use a motorcycle taxi service to go to the location, because the parking lot is quite far from the location. Apart from that, there tourists can bring souvenirs such as vegetables, fruit, fresh milk and others because there is a market available for shopping.

Great atmosphere, this place for city folks who doesn't connect to the nature on everyday life. Good place for eating some snacks and talks. They have guide to show the place around. This cafe managed by locals. The access to this is through the locals street so be careful when you go there cause there's kids on the road that play around. They have Guest house on this cafe.
The only downside here is that they play music from the speaker. For people like me who works in the city pak enjoying the silence of nature is better than some bad sound from speaker.

it such wonderful and peaceful place for you having holiday with family and friends. we can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the farming field and having snacks in the middle of farm. we can also buy directly from the farm of vegetables that are harvested ü•∞

Overall the cafe sawah itself is ok. Nice view. Service could be improved for better.
Rather difficult to order and take long time to get the food we order. Taste is standard. Ambience is ok. They also have rooftop area. There are some spots to take a picture (perhaps this is its USP Unique selling proposition).

Price is affordable, eventhough some visitors say the price is expensive.
If you want to go here just for eating, you will be disappointed because it is located inside village tourism area so that to enter/reach the restaurant, you have to pay ticket in the locket (12,5K/person) and parking (10k for car).
Payment : cash in major.

Very good coffee, quite possibly one of the best in town, worth the hype. Must go for double shot if you're ordering espresso. Single shot only if you cannot tolerate coffee.

This place has a strong traditional Javanese vibe to it. Not perfect for working, as it prioritizes on the cozy but great for social hangouts or couple trips.

Very good experience! You can enjoy tasty coffee and another drinks & foods here but don't be surprised coz the price is more expensive than other cafe on it's level.
But... Don't worry coz u will experience quite & locally vibes here, the place is sooo large and many choices for seat & ambiance you prefer.

Unfortunately, this natural vibe isn't consistent because of how they served drink. Just many of their menu are served with single use plastic glass, straws, & etc. Hopefully they will upgrade the service & packaging with more sustainable services üçÄüèûÔ∏èüåç

A big place, joglo style. It is expensive considering Jogja standard. The coffee is around 38-45k. The place can be hot due to lack of airflow somehow. One of the staff was smoking heavily and the smoke blew to our table. The chairs are not comfortable. Internet connection is not too good either, I got disconnected often from Zoom.

Good coffee, well snack, enjoy the ambience. If you want to meet your friend and have a nice conversation, you can go to this place. There are some facilities like park field, musholla and toilet.

Came here because It was on the movie ...
The vibe was alright.
The food was good and incredibly cheap.

BONCAFE RAYA GUBENG,ChIJHdhrVsj71y0RNwXC8yrtS_c,"Jl. Raya Gubeng No.46, Gubeng, Kec. Gubeng, Surabaya, Jawa Timur 60281, Indonesia","cafe, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment",4.7,6114,2.0,"A well known restaurant for Surabaya citizens. Serving Indonesian, Italian, Western food. They are well known for the steak but the other dishes still could be added up to your preference. The food is well prepared and tastes good as well. Looks simple but flavour sufficient enough to please your appetite.

Price wise moderate to expensive.

The taste and the variety of food, as well as the service are absolutely no doubt and I would say a recommended place to go. The main food that is offer in here is steak-based, from beef, chicken, lamb, and fish. There is also kids menu over here. The portion and the price is proportional. It is good when you want to invite your whole family to have food together.

The service is so fast by the mean the serving time. The place is so comfy and there is outdoor area. The health protocol is properly conducted by the staff that alway make sure everyone check in with pedulilindungi application. The parking is large enough especially for car.

This time I will tell you about my favourite food. That is fried rice. In my opinion, fried rice is everyone‚Äôs favourite food. Because fried rice can be eaten anytime and anywhere.

For example, at breakfast. Based on its history, fried rice comes from the bamboo curtain country, China. People used to cook fried rice because they didn‚Äôt want to throw away yesterday‚Äôs leftover rice. So that the rice is reprocessed with spices to make it more delicious.

However, over time, fried rice is made without the need to leave yesterday‚Äôs leftover rice. Because there are more and more fried rice traders who have quality taste. In addition, variations of fried rice are also increasingly diverse.

I like fried rice, because in addition to the delicious taste, this food can be eaten in various situations. Perfect for breakfast, but also perfect for dinner. And there‚Äôs nothing wrong if you enjoy it during the day.

I like Aceh fried rice the most. Although fried rice does not come from Aceh, the taste of Aceh fried rice is very distinctive. Some traders mix cinnamon, and some Indonesian spices.

Splurge, refined and sumptuous are three words that help wrap up all the dining-in experience I had in this legendary steakhouse. Its freshly prepared classical steak sauce is unmatched. It manages to balance the sweetness, the saltiness of the ingredients to give rise to the distinguished flavor and delicate aftertaste. It pleases the palates, becomes the most sought-after sauce that makes this steakhouse stand out of the rest.

it was my late dinner in their last order but the service still great and the food was delish ! thank you, definitely will come back üî•üî•üî•",0.925,0.3539049383430788,0.6794291234875238,4,"restaurant, surabaya, bamboo, application, opinion, soughtafter, splurge, comfy, anytime, proportional"

My son loved to be able to play with these things.  the food choices are diverse and unique, the taste of the food is very good, although it looks like the portion is small, but it makes you very full. the waiters are very friendly and most importantly the price is affordable!

I was very impressed when the food I ate wasn't what I ordered (because I didn't know it wasn't what I ordered, because I've never eaten it before, but it's still delicious) they replaced it with the right one for free. Thank you!

It looks good from the outside but the service and food is terrible. Cold eggs, cold beans, cold bread. We were told to get up from our table to order two English breakfasts, why can this not be done at the table?

I do not recommend.

Love the ambience here. It feels warm and cozy, the food tastes good too.

I utterly disappointed with this place. The only selling point about this place is if you want to look a proper selfie place. I ordered a manual brew coffe, a dragonfruit smoothie, and an avocado juice. The verdict is as follows :
Cofee = 3.5/5 adequate aroma not that strong
Dragonfruit smoothie= 2/5 too watery, bland
Avocado juice=1/5 don't order this at all
And one more thing, you should carry enough cash because this place doesn't accept any form of payment beside cash.

Enjoying my iced matcha latte with a view of train station, before I caught my train for a while. It's so close with the railways, so be careful.

The matcha latte, unfortunately, is too sweet for me. Seemed like it had more milk than the matcha itself.

It's really hot in the day. Better come here in the afternoon or evening, because there's no AC. Fan only

This is a must to visit! You sit right by the train tracks in bench seats. If you like some pour over coffee, please order their V60 from the Temanggung area - it is a striking beauty.
The staff is fantastic. We ordered three different V60 for a tasting and look at what they did in the picture...

Nice place for a short break and enjoy yogya tranquility.. located right next to yogya train station, decent food but a bit pricey for yogya standard.

It comes to my astonishment that they offer a quite tasty meal but cheaper than any other restaurants or cafes. Good job!

nice place, you can get fresh air n good view there. Recomended place for hangout with friends or couple to spend time in afternoon. There are some less tasty foods and beverage in my opinion like you know sausages in noodle menu and traditional drinks ""rempah-rempah"" the taste less good,but over all is okay...

Very cozy and instagram-able place! I guess mostly 'Kera ngalam' (Malang's youth people) knowed this place, because i got the recommendation from my friend in Malang.

The place are very big and wide. Its near from UMM (Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang) campus. There's outdoor&indoor suite room. For you who loves nature vibes, the outside suite room is really high recommended to chosen.

For the menu, there are a lot of food and beverages popular menu, such as 'Pisang Gigit', 'Roti Bakar', 'Hot Chocolate', 'Coffe beer'. I like the 'Kapiten Coffe Beer', you can drunk that beverages safety because its 0% alcohol even using beer as the mixed beverages with coffe. The taste is delicious also.

The price range for food is 25-45k. The drinks are 10-25k. The taste is so so I think, it's not bad, but not really delicious, but I think I'll come here again in the future because of the ambience and views

Has the potential to accomodate your needs of place to hangout when you are coming with quite some nunber of people. The cafe offers various seating options.

About the food, Soto Kudus they still maintain the taste, and they also provided another menu such as Ayam Kremes, good job!

Food are affordable. Too bad the Teh Tarik that I order is not warm, its more towards room temperature drinks, maybe because the 'tarik' release the heat of the drink itself. Pukis really serve right from the pan, still steaming hot.

Recommended menus based on my experiences: tenderloin cheese steak, beef lmentelar, black paper beef spaghetti (I forget its actual name), and garang asam beef oxtail/ribs.

The cafe building is pretty well resembling Rumah Joglo (traditional Javanese house). Several other items here are also representing fruit of Javanese culture.
They provide mostly local cuisine menu. However they also provide several western menu, such as Spagetti, Pizza, etc. The serving platting is very beautiful.
We really like the ambience of this cafe.

Worth waiting for. Coffee was good. Food was good. The place was good as well. I ordered macchiato coffee and quesadilla, meanwhile my friends ordered rawon and other food..my friend comment their Rawon is delicious too. I like the place because it's kind of unique as well..looks like it's adapting the javanese culture with their own philosophy.. It's a good experience coming to this place. I think I might hit their roastery in Jakarta as well üòÅ

Great place for coffee lovers: many different types of coffee, different brewing methods. Great choice on the food menu, local and occidental.
Not everything on the menu is available though, not everything served corresponds to the description or the pictures shown.
The staff hardly speaks English.
We had the caramel mocha, the praline hot cocoa with marshmallows, pancakes stack (all delish) and fries with cheese & jalape√±o sauce (disappointing).

Best place to enjoy local Indonesian coffee in Malang. They served the best coffee bean from all around Indonesia üôèüôè

This is a great place to chill The atmosphere is quite comfortable. The place is also unexpectedly spacious. They have indoor and outdoor seating areas. Recommend if you want to relax after touring Jogja and want dessert/sweet

The ice cream itself is quite okay, they have some variety of flavours. We've also tried Apple Pie, Smores Milk Pie, Cinnamon Rolls, Choco Cookie, Red Velvet, Lasagna, Macaron Schotel is the bomb.. nothing fails and all very delicious. We keep ordering again and again üòç

This place is for you if you one of those sweet tooths. Must try the ice cream. Theirs not too sweet, more into ""dairy"" side. Not so much ice cream flavors, but all of them is great. The price is also reasonable.
Interior has aesthetic design, great to just talking with friends but not recommended to work/study bcs it is quite noisy and theres no charging port.

One of the most famous gelato cafes in Yogyakarta.
Milk by Artemy used to be called only Artemy but they did some rebranding and even moved to this location with better concept.
The place is located not on main street, so trust Gmaps to take you here.
You can park your cars or motorcycles on the side of the road.
The place will greet you with the gelato display right on the side of the entry door.
So you can directly pick your gelato before entering the cafe.
They have may range of flavors that you can pick.
It has some baked goods like cakes, pies, buns as well.
The interior is aesthetically pleasing, perfect for those looking for a place to snap some pictures for your social media.
They have smoking area on the side filled with plants to absorbs the smoke, nice!
Definitely don't come here during weekend or holidays since it will be hard to find a place to sit, since people tend to stay longer after they finished their gelato.

Good place for milk-based gelato. Biga scoops with a thin wafer on top. Kinda sweet for my tastes, though.

Chocolate were out by the time we got there, it was around 3 pm.

I think the quality of the taste of food and drinks needs to be improved, including the coffee.  But this place is quite interesting to be used as a photo spot.

Good place to chill, their coffee was so good too. I ordered coffee mocha (35k) and cheese cake (38k), it's quite pricey (for me) since it's also excluded tax and service, wkwk.

The place is clean and tidy. The concept is modern industrial and what-they-so-called 'instagramable'. Great taste, I love their beef nahm-jim and lemonade.

Every corner is a great place to take pictures of. Also to note, not many drivers are familiar with the place (they all looked puzzled upon seeing the place) as it's hidden in Malang city‚Äînext to a rice field (it's quite chilly there).

Love it, because they don't use a single use plastic. the price i think is Cheap in rate 10.000-30.000  The consep  cafe garden, make u feel relax. For take away they can't because they not use single use plastic.

A cafe with an eco concept, utilizing used goods for furniture, lamps, decorations, pots for plants, and others.

In serving food & drinks, this cafe does not provide straws, tissue and disposable packaging. The menu list is also not printed, (because if will change the menu or the price will print it again) so you just need to go through the barcodes installed on each table.

The atmosphere in here comfortable, in the middle of vegetable & flower fields, perfect for relaxing with friends, colleagues and relatives.

Their service is sufficient, the friendliness of the waiters may need to be improved. Prices for food & drinks at this cafe are still reasonable. So, it's worth it to try and visit here, guys

Best find in Batu! An eccentric retro cafe with eco-friendly concept filled with tons of plants. Very affordable price, most of the menu ranges from 15-25k.

After exploring many coffee shops, I found one coffee shop which I think is really worth it for students like us to visit üòÄ.  Nakoa cafe Bondowoso is one of my favorite hangout cafes, it seems I have visited this cafe countless times.  The reason why Nakoa is my favorite cafe is that most of the people who come here are students doing their assignments, so it makes the atmosphere of the cafe calm and not chaotic.  The people at Nakoa also don't care about visitors, so I think Nakoa is really good for me time.  My favorite menu here is the matcha latte üíö.  Apart from the matcha latte, the drinks here are also delicious.  The price is also standard, which is under 25,000.  Apart from selling drinks, here they also sell some delicious food, moreover, the donuts are really delicious and cheap üòÉ.  For those of you who like to do assignments alone, you can really try this Nakoa cafe.

The place so comfy for works both indoor and outdoor, the coffee is great too. WiFi so fast, the staff so friendly, i have a good experience at Nakoa Cafe, just need some improvement to make the toilet clean. Overall is good, i'll come again to Nakoa Cafe. Waiting for the new menu for filling my tummy.

This is a special place for co-working which makes it also a great coffee shop. Italian espresso machine Simonelli makes nice coffees and you feel like being in a sort of modern museum. Really outstanding design....well done!

Taste of the food is delicious, they have many variations of satay. You can ask to re heat the satay, and they will grill the satay again. It will be great if they re grease the satay with kecap or their own sauce. Rice also very delicious, all of the variant is worth to try. My only complaint is there is not much snack or gorengan, only satay, rice and drink. Price is okay, not on the cheap side, but also not to be considered pricy.

it is Setup as a Traditional Angkringan, But almost everything is leaning towards modern food style, The Kopi Joss still uses Hot Charcoal but the coffee itself they used Instant mix Coffee from a scahet, the choices of food also consist mainly of children's food of choice such as various meatballs, sausage, with alot of MSG and salt for taste.
Don't get me wrong, their food still taste great but I miss the real traditional food that angkringan used to serve in the old days
Lucky the setup of the place still feels authentic, and price wise its still worthy to be called Angkringan.

A very unique experience for slow living in Yogyakarta. Sipping a glass of charcoal infused coffee after dark on a floor mat along the street, can‚Äôt be found in Singapore.
The Kopi o tastes more smooth as the charcoal neutralized the sourness of the coffee powder. I initially thought the red hot charcoals will be super hot, but they cool down pretty soon.
Select the skewers and the uncle will help you to grill them again, his skewers have a nice smoked flavor that I like, that is lacking in typical loklok in jb.
Came on Monday evening crowd is sparse.
Will be back again if I am in Yogyakarta.
Cost 22k

A good place to have coffee with your friends, but a glass of coffee with a hot charcoal inserted into it is nothing special. It just tastes the same compared to a glass of ordinary coffee. But it is the sensation that makes it unique. There are a lot of snacks too in angkringan style. This place is worth to try!

Chicken was served in a hotplate and I hardly wait to try with sauce.

Chicken was hot.
But the sauce was cold as fff, same with the mini croquet and veggies.

Stepping through concrete pads to the spinning door, I was welcomed by a calm home atmosphere on Sunday morning to meet good coffee drinks with friendly prices.
The coffee stands its true flavor decorated by a milky splash. It definitely suits those who care for some caffeine boost. A point that bothers me personally is just that it was served in a plastic glass, loosening the authentic touch.
Dekker Koffie is unquestionably a nice place for transit before heading home from work. The greens in and  around the venue absorb fatigue to help customers bring home a  fresh smile.

Have u tried this place? U should! I especially love the coffee, any kind of their coffee is suitable for me. And the ambience is very cozy, nice place to hang out or spend ur time in goodway.

The caf√© has a great ambience both outside and inside the caf√©. It has a delicious food you can order for lunch.

Overall this caf√© is comfortable for hangout with friends. The coffee is good tho. The price? Way cheaper than the overated caf√© around there üòÇ",1.0,0.0200312626642737,0.5786134429456377,31,"coffee, ambience, campus, definitely, koffie, bring, pads, offday, brief, bothers"

The place is widely lit with huge sun ceiling bringing a great vibe for those occupied with their study. Socket plug was ample. The place goes long way back with more outdoor seatings. The drinks are alright and the food as well. Price was mediocre. Liked the vibe here and decided to spend half of my day here.

Such a beautiful coffee shop. The interior design is excellent and the menus are exquisite. Some of the sofas are very comfortable. You can either hang out with you friends and family or study in here. It is quite pricey and you have to pay for additional taxes but it's still worth the price. It has a large parking lot, a prayer's room and clean toilets.

This coffee shop is a comfortable place to study for hours. They have outdoor and indoor seats. You can come here alone or with friends.

I bought caramel macchiato and though the coffee not too strong, it was tasty. The mozarella stick was quite good too. They serve coffee, meal and snacks. Price is reasonable, not too pricey but they charge 10% ppn.

They have spacey parking lot for car or motorbike. Musala and toilet are outside the building, not too clean but musala is spacey.

My first time coming here and it's a good place for study, work, or just hangout. The interior theme aligns with the cafe name, Kaktus. There are kaktus in the parking lot and on the tables. Anywhere.

Also there are hanging plants on the indoor ceiling. It gives the serene ambience.

The menu are various with reasonable price. There's also packed ice cream in a display freezer, which is interesting; but I forgot to buy it at the end because I was too tired.

I ordered mix platter and iced salted caramel latte with extra shot of espresso. The food's came in a big portion and variation. The drink's good because it's not too sweet--maybe because of the extra shot.

There are many seating options; outdoor and indoor. Upstairs or downstairs.

The parking is not free, but spacious.

People keep coming in and out; means that this place is famous. It's just me who's not really good in finding good cafes.

A casual spot for hang out with mix of working or even doing your meeting with friends/colleagues.

Large parking area for motorcycle in the back and enough space for cars too.

Good service from their staffs too. Price is okay and taste wise is good. Keep it up yah!",0.8999999999999999,0.1505239390956985,0.5777252938111502,32,"cafe, menus, pricey, mozarella, ambience, students, space, taxes, motorbike, liked"

Food and beverages are all good. If you like savory, their Chicken Pie is good! And if you like savory dish with tomatoes, try Shakshuka (morning only).

One of the best Coffee Shop in town. Coffee tastes great. Not too many fancy option tho. Pastries are many. Food is delicious. Service is great, the workers work fast with good hospitality. Atmosphere is awesome, you can pick to sit on the indoor with AC or outdoor with direct golf view. That's why many people come for meeting, work with their laptop, hangout with friends. You can also drive thru your order. Parking space is for free because it's inside Graha area. Their croissant is delicious, their salad is good.

Nice restaurant within an upscale neighbourhood in Malang.

Foods and drinks are great and delicious.

The ambiance is amazing and it is pretty busy and popular among young people.

Wifi is available even though it's not that good. Maybe because it is prerty crowded even during weekdays.

There's plenty of seats and tables here, indoor and 2 floor, and some outdoor seating. Good variety of menu, and with fair price to considering the place. Free wifi, great service. Their food and drink tastes good too. Parking space is big for car and bike, you pay the fee on the entrance via langsep. There's also a paid photobox here.

This cafe, which is located on Jalan Dieng, is a comfortable place to just do your assignments or hang out with friends and family. The menu itself is quite varied and quite unique. Apart from coffee, milk and tea, there are also snacks such as french fries, potato wedges, chicken yakitori, takoyaki, onion rings. For heavy food is also quite varied.

Inside the Cafe there is also a photo booth at a price of Rp. 35,000 can already take funny photos. The advantages of this place are that the cashier who serves is quite friendly and the place is quite spacious. The drawback is that there are few employees so no one cleans the table so if visitors come there are still food leftovers from previous visitors

Hands up for the empanadas & red wine from ‚ÄúNoches de Almazen‚Äù (event they organize some Saturdays night). We also tried the dulce de leche cheese cake and alfajores, and everything was delicious!
We took home to try beef milanesas, homemade ravioli, dulce de leche, dulce ice cream and alfajores, yerba mate with coconut (they also have with mint and ginseng). Everything looks good and the have lot of options more!

the beans used for manual brew is get from local area, occasionally they'll have a guest beans from far away...

Cheap and delicious, all affordable, on the side of a major road, the price is suitable for students. You can also hang out while watching UB's walking activities.

really good woyyy!! where is it cheap? Mom, I'm addicted to it hahaha.. If you're at home, the mainstay of the Aladin menu is boba fresh milk. Its advantages besides being cheap, if it doesn't run out, you can put it in the refrigerator again and the plus point is that even though the boba is still chewy until tomorrow! the location is in front of the UB, which is Mt Haryono, if you're coming from the McD direction, go left. you have to be slow"" look for it because it's a bit narrow. but don't worry because the color of the shop is green, so it's definitely visible.

The taste is really authentic where the prices are also friendly again. The place is relatively quiet and comfortable",1.0,0.0028946911364557,0.5712447171886759,52,"choco, silverqueen, cream, menu, prices, ubs, refrigerator, advantages, walking, hahaha"

It's all over to Malang, strayed from the starfruit, manganese or Seblak to the nek ae rek, uanek. Original.

The place is comfortable, good for coffee while working on assignments. There is wifi and plugs, so you forget more about time.

My regular place to eat and hang out has moved here, so it's bigger than the government's promise, the food is obviously delicious as good as mother's cooking, fast WiFi can make ZUMA great, there's a prayer room too who knows how to pray, although usually only once during Friday prayers, parking space is also wide. You know, I want to bring a FUSO truck, there are more and more seats, I want an event to invite members of the RT, there are also plugs that can charge electric motorbikes, now I'm also diligent in holding promos, AKA NDANG GASNO MRENE AE LAH COK.

It's comfortable for hanging out while doing assignments with besti ges, in terms of taste and the price is also affordable..

Everything is good, the food, fast service, and the most important thing is in the way they adjust music volume. Most of cafe in Sidoarjo set their music loudly so that it is so annoying. But this cafe is something else, we still can enjoy the music but it is not annoying.

There is no doubt about the food. They are worth every penny. The taste are amazing with good portion you won't regret.

The place is clean, refreshing, super comfortable and recomended to those who love to just sit and do some stuff, hang out or even have a date there.

Been here for several times. The place is comfortable enough though it gets really crowded at times. The food and drinks are really worth the price. Loved the food here, as well as the beverages!

I love the cafe ambiance, cozy and beautifully set. There are indoor with cozy couch and dining table also outdoor for smoking area. The food and drinks menus are vary, lots of choices whether you want to have big meal or just simply snacking. Unfortunately they don't serve hot cappucino or latte, it's only warm. Also the choco lava cake is hard, the chocolate doesn't melt when you cut it.

Come from Surabaya to Sidoarjo on weekend to try food and beverages in this cafe. The ambiance was good, there were many seats available there. For foods and beverages are a variety. I bought croissants, iced matcha latte, and spaghetti black pepper.
If I may give a suggestion for a croissant, it is better to ask the customer first whether to warm it or not. Because I bought a croissant usually served crispy, but yesterday maybe because the chocolate melted when reheated so it reduced the texture of the croissant

Plus : nice vibes, lot of space (indoor & outdoor), delicous beverage & meals, reasoanble price.

Suggestion: there is no menu book yet, so ask the owner what menus are available, as well as what menu recommendations are suitable.

Been here countless time already and never been disappointed. The latte was not bad, it was well-balanced with a rather acidic note in every sip. The texture was creamy and smooth as well. Fried rice was okay. The scrambled eggs in the All Time Breakfast could be runnier but the potatoes were nicely seasoned. Another visit? Definitely yes.

It is another restaurant recommended by my Surabaya friend.üòä
The meals and drinks at Carpentier Kitchen are fresh and tasty.

The service is very good, especially quite responsive.

There are two floors, and on each floor, visitors can see goods displayed in a nice manner.

The washrooms are clean.

Both of them made us their signature drinks outside what's on the menu and it tasted divine! They asked how was my experience in the hotel and what could be improved.

There is a new coffee shop, located inside UB, just outside the UB central library. The shop is really small, you can sit in the aisles/chairs outside the library, which are usually used by students to hang out or do assignments.

The menu is quite diverse, the price may be relatively a little expensive, but the taste is quite good, so it's not bad. Service okay and fast.

Not only coffee, tea too. I am very happy to be able to work with coffee alumni. Recommended for enjoying the vibes of the UB library.

[Foods & Beverages]: Most of menu choices that we tried are delicious, such as salted egg soft-shell crab and fried oxtail soup.
[Price]: Average restaurant price since the price is pretty balance with taste and portion.
[Others]: Definitely recommended for group lunch/dining since they have various menu choices. The only cons is¬†we got 2 different prices menu book (old price & new ones) so we need to be careful. Hopefully the management notice and withdraw the old price menu book.

Clearly one of the best place to eat out with friends and family. The atmosphere is great, spacious place, modern & minimalistic style. The foods and drinks are plentiful to choose, good taste also. Small notes though, the asparagus soup tasted a little bit odd. All is perfect, but will be better if the price can be a little bit lower

Provides many kinds of chinese dishes. the place is comfortable to hang out. The outside place we can enjoy with the view of fields. The dishes is good but there are nothing distinctive taste

A restaurant with a mountain view so you can eat and talk for a long time with friends and even family. You can choose indoor or outdoor. Fast service with quite a number of waitresses.

My food favorite is the green chilli fried rice.. One of the best green chili fried rice I've ever eaten, maybe the topping needs to be added variety. All food served is delicious.

For the atmosphere im not kindda fan of it because the place was really tight on alley, and alot of people smoke, but yeah its okay if you dont realy mind of it

Refreshment drinks, a variety of milk beverages, either with ginger, spice-herbals, honey and/or egg yolks. Since 1974, it started as a family business and remains until now, in a narrow alley of Malang urban dwelling.

Racikan STMJ nya pas di lidah.. bikin nyaman di badan..
Ada gorengan, kerupuk, keripik dan roti bakar jg sbg side dish :)

Bisa buat nongkrong..

A must try

perfectly how to mix and brew from starting with boiling milk mixed with eggs, honey and ginger stirred evenly with care so that it produces best rich and  soft taste without a fishy smell of egg.

They have many coffee menus, and if you are not so into coffee, you can still reserve a mild coffee menu like hazelnut, caramel, mocha, etc. They serve noncoffee too.
There are so many tables on three floors. If you are a smoker, don't too worry, they have a smoking room area on the 3rd floor and in front of the entrance. For people who need to work on a laptop for a long time, you can find charging outlets on every corner. Placed in a strategic area, it is a complete coffee shop!

Love the ambience. If you wanna stay long and do some work with a nice cup of coffee, then this is the place. I came to this place a few times and totally gonna come back again. The coffee is üòã yums. Love it. And really glad for all the staff who works there, they were really friendly and when they tried their best to explain to me about the various coffee choices in English. Would definitely come back!

The place looks small but there are actually 3 storeys, and only the third storey is allowed for smoking. They have good choices of drinks and good wifi, pretty suitable for working. It's just the chairs are not so comfortable if you work there long enough. Drinks are quite pricey (30k+).

I came to use the co-working space at 9 am in the morning and meet a friend. They didn't serve Indonesian breakfast (that is a full meal with rice) but they do have selections of pastries and cakes to lightly stuff your stomach. I ordered Kopi Subuh (orange juice, tonic water, espresso) and earl grey banana cake. The caf√© have 3 stories: the first one is the lobby where the coffee machine, the second one is an air conditioned room, and the third one is a smoking room. I stayed in the second stories until lunch o'clock. It has the view of Slamet Riyadi street, air conditioning, and a very loud music. It will be better if they could lower the music down. I mean, it's heard to talk with your colleague when you have your noise-cancelling earphone on üòÖ

I rarely got attached to a coffee shop but this one is an exception. The coffee was nice with plenty of variation. The cake in the showcase are preheated before it got served. They also got internet wifi with high speed.

A comfy place with wide places and there's also smoking area and AC area. The beverages was pretty good with affordable price. The only downside in this place is the toilet just only few. They need to add more for this cafe in the future. Overall, good cafe that you can get in the town.

We looking forward to try the almond croissant but unfortunately it already sold out. So we try strawberry danish and meat pie, which pretty decent but still not what we expect from the lot of good reviews written. Personally, prefer the pastry to be more flaky and the filling both sweet or savour more balanced. Place is indeed pretty picturesque if you like to take a photo but not that much place for dine in. I recommend to come in the morning if you want to try all their selection and want to dine in.

My fave pastry place! They have various options of pastry, super tasty with affordable price. The place is cozy and instagramable, it‚Äôs a nice place for hangout in the afternoon or after office time. Unfortunately the coffee isn‚Äôt so good. And sometimes most of the bestseller items are sold out, but they usually restock it again at noon. If you want to try their various or bestseller items i suggest to come around 9-11am. But i still love this place, everything beside the coffee is nice, the pastries, the place, the staff even the parking man is friendly n has a good manner!

The ambience of this place is nice. It' good to chill here by yourself or with your friends. The workers here is friendly, they will check your temperature as well. This place has non-smoking and smoking area which are quite big. You can park you motorbike infront of the building, they also provide a parking area for car. The food and beverages itself is tasty.

The place is nice, really comfortable for group discussion, casual hangout, or having proper meal. The place is always packed up with young adults as the place is very close to student residences. However, the coffee price is a bit overpriced. Americano costs 31k and the coffee is so-so. In Jakarta, 31k for Americano is common, we can even get really good coffee for 28k. here in Jogja I expect so-so coffee cost not more than 30k.

Service was impeccable. Both our meals were fresh and delicious! Definitely need to check them out again on our next visit!

I highly recommend this place. Food was delicious, far above our expectations. Fresh, tasty, good presentation. Arrived after 4pm and the promo was a fantastic saving. Great, professional service. Place is exceptionally clean and we loved the extra touch of lemongrass fragrance added to the well maintained restroom. Well done!

When you find that perfect spot and keep going back! Menu isn't huge so you know the food is going to be fresh, well made and absolutely delicious. Even better is getting a great coffee(just like being in Melbourne‚òï
Even though they don't do delivery, we could order and have the Villa pick it up for us. Fantastic!! Special thanks to one of the newer staff, Nata, who is so helpful and welcoming.

This place! Started off with a popular gin drink.

I had the bowl. Every bite was flavor orgasm, no joke.

Such a nice place to take a rest with a cup of coffee for a while with family. The atmosfer is vintage javanese in the middle of freshness of forest of pine. Live music will acompany you while enjoying drinks and meal...very nice

located on the 2nd floor of the tempe spiritual chip shop. comfortable place. there is parking. the room has a terrace, inside, and there is a meeting room.

the price with the portion and taste is appropriate (even very satisfying at that price). I tried drinking lemon tea and eating spicy basil chicken... the chicken is delicious, for those who like spicy it's just right, the basil is just right. not so fragrant basil. so even if you don't like basil, you can still eat this. for the plating and packaging is also okay.

but because the location is on the 2nd floor, it's not suitable for older people... earlier I slipped on the stairs too because the footing was too small and tight (in my opinion)

Hands down one of the most comfortable coffeeshops in Malang. Even though the location is not too close to the Soehat area, it turns out that the trip there is worth it.

First, you see the building looks like a vintage house, but overall it looks neat, the combination with the furniture which is dominated by wood, fits perfectly. It feels cool and homey, especially the area isn't too crowded, so you can feel calm.

Try ordering the Japanese brew and heavy food. Make the coffee just right and make it proper, following the barista's advice for the choice of beans, and it turns out to be exactly according to taste. There are many drink menu choices, whether you want coffee or non-coffee.

For food, you can order curry rice, this one is special. I myself don't often order heavy food at coffeeshops in Malang, but here it really is, the food is delicious. The curry is really good, even though it's not too thick but the taste itself is delicious. Plus there is katsu which is big in size and rice which seems to be in the panfry again so it has a taste. The food combination is really delicious, guaranteed not to regret it. And the portions are huge for the price. For now it's a favorite curry in Malang, you can even find something unique in a coffee shop. There are also several kinds of heavy food and all of them are interesting, of course I will try the others on my next visit.

The service is also very friendly and quite good, can also provide an explanation regarding the food and drinks that we will order, where a brief description is also given on the menu.

The seating area consists of indoor, semi-outdoor and outdoor. I myself sat in the semi-outdoor patio area near the bar. There are also plugs available so that it is suitable for working while drinking coffee and eating. The smoking area is in the outdoor near the parking lot. The seats themselves aren't that many, but considering the proportions to the build, they're just right.

Additional facilities such as wifi are also available, there are also toilets.

Parking for cars is in front of the coffeeshop while motorbikes are in the side area, enough to accommodate visitors.

Overall, it's really nice to have coffee in a quite different area, a quiet area. Suitable for work while enjoying coffee. Plus, the food is delicious, this is really a plus, so you don't have to bother moving places to eat.

Oh yeah, there's a lot on the menu here! what I'm trying this time is;

1. Milk base charcoal
2. Sweet mango yakult
3. Spicy Tofu
4. Chicken ori barbeque sauce with mayo

When I tried the chicken ori barbeque, it tasted really good! the chicken meat is abundant & not much skin is rich in other places! Barbeque sauce & mayonnaise here are not stingy either. You can get one special portion of this for only 14K!

The place is behind the Aston hotel, towards agro tourism. There are outdoor and indoor seats (the outdoor ones are guaranteed not to get too hot because they are under a big tree). Prices for standard food and drink cafe Malang-batu. There are not too many variations on the food and drink menu, especially the snacks (I hope there will be more snack menus for snack friends to hang out with). My friends and I tried to order some basic coffee drinks and heavy food. The cappuccino is standard, so is the bentala coffee. According to my friends, the brewed coffee was runny, even though I ordered 2 shots. For the chicken curry 7/10, the seasoning for the curry sauce is lacking. There's a lot of rice. For noodles, it's standard 7/10. Overall okay. Repurchase? Yes

The most comfortable coffee shop in the city of Batu in my opinion. the place is clean, cozy, not too crowded, the place is not too passed by vehicles either. suitable for assignments or just chatting with friends, it feels like you don't want to go home. Not only is it a great place, the food is also delicious too. The price is quite affordable among students' pockets. basically, if you go to the bendala, you won't feel it if it's already late at night. you are cool at home

The place is comfortable, clean, and there are several choices of seating spots. There are many menu choices at affordable prices, perfect for casual coffee or events with your bestie, crush, or friends

The best coffee shop for self healing, the atmosphere is cool, not too crowded, the coffee is delicious, the snacks are also delicious, the prices are worth it and tend to be cheap compared to other famous coffee shops in Batu, Gokss bentala! ‚ú®",0.975,0.0021420714409772,0.5566710907196202,1030,"cafe, malangbatu, bentala, comfortable, mas, menus, repurchase, concept, cool, especially"

Nice place and coffee like home

The nuances of Europe, especially the Netherlands, are immediately felt as soon as you enter a cafe called Huize Jon Coffe. This cafe, which is located on Jl Majapahit, Malang City, carries a different theme compared to other cafes. The combination of Javanese and European nuances, especially the Netherlands, is very strong. From the outside, the modern feel of the building greets every visitor who enters the cafe. Meanwhile, when entering the inside of the cafe, a number of Javanese antique objects are immediately visible. A pair of statues of people dressed in traditional Javanese clothes immediately become an icon on the inside. On the inside of the cafe space, there is also a large Dutch language inscription ""Hartelijk Welkom on Malang. Huize Djon Geschickt Voor Het Maken Van Mooie Uitstapjes Gezzelige Sfeer Voor Iedere Gast"". The writing has the real meaning of Welcome to Malang. Several ancient European and Javanese ornaments, ranging from classic wall clocks made in Germany that are more than 75 years old, televisions, old radios, various leather puppets, classic photographs, to ancient carvings to decorate the sides of the cafe.
The Dutch nuance is also increasingly felt with the inscription in Dutch on the north side of the room, namely 'Uitsmijter Toast'. Uitsmijter itself is the name of a typical Dutch sandwich, while toast means toast.
For the menu offered at Huize Jon, there are various processed coffees such as Original Wine Robusta Coffe, Van Den Berg Wine Robusta Coffe, French Press, Americano, and several other processed coffees. However, for the superior menu at this place, visitors need to try the Dutch special Huize Jon coffe, which is Dutch coffee slightly adjusted to be suitable for consumption by the people of Malang. For menus other than coffee, there are several other choices, such as milkshakes, tea, chocolate, or even ginger. Apart from drinks, this place also provides a food menu, such as french fries, indomie, spring rolls, sandwiches, and several other menu choices written in Dutch, such as Gebakken aardappelen, Vleeskroketjes met mustard, Pannekoek, and various other choices.

Coffee shop that has old skool vibes. serves a variety of coffee and non-coffee drinks and other snacks at affordable prices.

Clean place, pin point map according to location, and there is lodging too.

Not to mention,the healthy delicious rice bowl with chicken mushroom brings tummies just the right portion to smile.

I personally love coffee more without sugar. And this place accommodates those who doesn't like sugar opt it out to preserve the honest coffee sensation.

Moving from the previous spot, Rata Rata has now found a nest in Ditaman Ada Kedai, an open space with homey touch. Friends and nostalgic mates come here to indulge in coffee in the silent afternoon cool breeze. Memories, as well as new plan, are shared over delicacies and laughter.

This place is a perfect place to slow our mind down a bit after work before going home for some good night rest. At night, the coffees are even more better to enjoy accompanied by fresh air and cricket stridulation.

Definitely one of the most unique cafes out there. Many instagrammable spots inside this cafe.

Enjoyed some work time in front of my laptop woth some snacks and drinks. Veru comfortable place.

The foods and drinks are also great. The service from the staff is also veru welcoming and friendly. Definitely will be back.

Cozy place,comfort food,worthy price. Instagramable spot,kids friendly,very recommended üëå

I ordered mie goreng and tea., the tea taste really good. Mie goreng was abit salty., next time should try the coffee. I went there before christmas, they put nice christmas ornaments

The atmosphere there is good.
But the food there is not really satisfying. Honey chicken was either over-fried or fried again and the taste is very ordinary. Not going to pay a cafe price for that kind of food quality.
There heritage noodles also taste just like mie goreng from any other street food stores. Sorry to say, taste and potion are better in those food stores.
So, not very recommend to eat there.
However, the coffee is ok.

If you're a morning person, this place may suit your appetite looking for new ideas. It has an Instagrammable view at every corner. There are variety of coffee and food menu when you're looking forward of a big breakfast. The price is in middle range. It's not too expensive nor too cheap as well. But, the taste of the food is so so for me. The service is okay despite I've had uncomfortable event when the waiter was reluctantly serving us breakfast. Maybe I should come another day to

Place review :
So this outlet has a unique and cool model in my opinion, it's more like a Korean theme ""alay like that, the seats use private material and the original is nice to look at but this material if it gets hit by rain it will rot and break
This outlet is staffed by mothers and children, the mother may be in charge of taking care of food such as donuts, waffles etc. while the cute and virgin part of the barista-style drinks, it's a shame the two of them don't wear cool uniforms like outlets"" the other one instead wears short shorts. wkwkwk üòÇ...(tomorrow just wear lingerie so it's badaasss), but they still feel clumsy in the halter eh not flexible when making the order process, the plus point is that the mother-child duo are friendly üôè, one more this outlet is more for take away as a table There are no chairs, there are only chairs for waiting for the order, only 2 birds

Food review: the drinks are manstab abiz semanstab the video is cut tari vs ariel noah... oops üôä, the process of making waffles and donuts takes quite a long time even though I saw them using modern equipment (I can imagine if you get a lot of orders it will definitely be more complicated and the process will be more delayed takes a long time...

That's all... warm greetings from Garangan Elegant

The coffee taste is strong, the quality is also the best. There are donuts & cirengnya also delicious. Keep up the quality & qualityüëåüèª

The atmosphere is really good.. it is recommended to wear a jacket upstairs the air is free so it feels cold..
The food and drinks are delicious, all of them are good... don't be disappointed

Not enough to make you feel at home.. uno blocks / uno cards

Wafa Coffee n' Space, the place is cute, clean with white and white nuances. Apart from looking cute and clean with the white tones on the building, Wafa for some reason, in my view, is just as homey as it is on the 1st floor. That doesn't mean the 2nd floor isn't comfortable. Judging from the arrangement of furniture and decorative ornaments, Wafa seems to have been designed for those of you who want to get together while being productive, but also comfortable for those of you who like to drink coffee alone, really comfortable.

Talking about the menu, you will find a lot of mixed drink menus, both cold milk coffee variants and non-coffee variants created by Wafa. Don't forget, there are also heavy meals and snacks, you know. For heavy meals, there are rice bowls with several flavors, which, to be honest, tastes good to me, pol mesio. I haven't tried it in a long time, and for snacks, you can guess for yourself.
For the price, Wafa prices its drinks and food at around 15 thousand to 25 thousand, if I'm not mistaken.

The service is good, it's just that Wafa currently seems to be hampered by the number of human resources, so sometimes you have to wait a little longer for your order to arrive.
But apparently that's a plus point, you know. So you can chat first with your friends or something like that.

Actually Wafa has a really nice atmosphere. It's good for being alone, it's good for being together, but it's a shame that Wafa's location is on the side of a road which is quite busy with driving activity so it's sometimes a bit noisy.
But it's okay, it's called the way of many people.

That's about it, the rest you can stop by directly at Wafa. I hope you all agree with the place, menu, and service provided by Wafa. Xalaam!!

Uwuuw for coffee... The price is right, the taste is delicious, it's great...

Run by a couple, Virginia and Evan, their cheerful personality can be a great company while you enjoy your drink of choice. These two are excellent sparing partner in cards playing so if you want to test your strategy while sipping on your delicious coffee, ask them to play cards with you. They also provide delicious choices of quick-grab food for your lunch or dinner whenever you feel like you want something to eat but not too heavy to match with your coffee. A group of four would be a great choice to visit while more than that can be quite overcrowded. There are selection of manga books you can choose to read and you can request a song or two to enjoy. One minor setback, the parking spot is limited so car-driving visitors may find it a little challenging to find a spot to park. Best if you are driving a motorcycle or bicycle. Check out this place to enjoy new coffee drinking experience.

Edit per July 3rd, 2022:
There's a new coffee drink they added called Mario's Specialty. Why the name? Go and find it out by yourself, there's a story behind it. It tastes quite easy on the tongue with all the goodness of what the coffee beans may offer plus the richness of milk and some other secret ingredients only they - Virginia and Evan, the owner - know. You can customized the level of sweetness (standard/half/quarter) to suit your own taste. Check out the last photo I added for a quick sample of the drink. My grade for this one? 9 out of 10. Love it. It is my new standard drink whenever I visit the place. You should check it out too. I'm sure you won't disappointed on this one. Happy trying and let me know your thought on it.

Small coffee shop in a neighborhood. The coffee is quite nice and the service is very good on my two visits. The price is excellent. There is only outdoor seating for about 6 people total. Staying in this neighborhood, it‚Äôs perfect to just swing by and grab a quick coffee!!!

Great place to find a flavor, coffee and japanese dishes they have. Great!

Nice coffee

Before coming here, I often ordered food and drinks from this cafe via the Gojek application. Out of curiosity about the place, I finally took the time to come to enjoy it in person. And I don't regret it!

This cafe has a relatively small place. There are two tables with several benches. So my advice, if you want to come in a group, no more than 4 people. Even though it's small, my experience here is still fun and filling!

The place is cozy and calm. It has such a great design and aesthetic, even in a rice field area in the middle of Kota Mojokerto. The menu has many variations. When I went there, lucky me, they served a delicious chocolate cake. Quite pricy but still worth buying.

My fave beverage is the rosella, so refreshing and tasty. I once ordered the curry katsu, and it was so pleasing. The baristas are helpful and friendly. They will briefly explain and help you to choose the menu.

The cafe has outdoor and indoor sections; I like to stay in their indoor area because the ambiance is so pleasant, and we can see the baristas making beverages behind the bar.

The cafe is recommended for you to hang out with your friends.

Very nice place and ambience. The beverages and foods are gud. The services and the people are nice

The location is a bit hidden, in the middle of farmfield, and away from crowd. However, the place is usually full. They offers a good coffee with reasonable prices.

Its okay cozy and good food more than price. Recomended

great coffee, they have in-house roastery, and you could buy roasted coffee beans there, and ask them to grind it if you didn't have grinder at home. the only minus for me, is the mushola looks so dirty, and hidden in the 2nd floor, and didn't really well kept & clean

but I do highly recommend the smoking / non-smoking room, for a casual or business meeting. I usually visit Labore after 19.00, their night vibe is also lovely.

Java Dancer located in a quiet residential area. It is small enough to seat about 15 people, and the interior is as cute as its pretty name. Even though it is early for dinner, there are 7-8 locals seated. Ordered a salad and chicken for coffee and a light meal. Quantity is more than expected. Delicious coffee and food. But Salad is so salty.

After a hot day wandering lost and stressed around Malang, this was such a relaxing place to cool off. We felt so happy and relaxed in this beautiful shop, surrounded by plants and the sound of bubbling water.

They have single origin coffees from around Indonesia, which can be brewed in five different ways. This was fun to tour. We tried the Kintamani brewed in a siphon, which was mild, with a mango juice they prepared with 100% mango and cream. So refreshing! It's a little expensive as they have some extra charges for certain taxes, which was explained in the menu. Just don't be surprised by the bill.

The ambiance is the strongest point, along with a great menu of drinks and food.

Cosy open air caf√© with extensive menu for both international and local food! We came here for the espressos and they really hit the spot! We indulged on an affogato and ginger latte as well as some delicious pancakes and roti bantal with chocolate!

Wonderful decor and experience for a foreigner like me to see the batik, masks and other traditional puppets. We went between meals but The food looked amazing and I would love to go back and try it.

Ordered hot cappuccino with extra shoot..They used their specialty house blend coffee..

There was an outdoor picnic set up for groups, interesting.

I only go there once, and i think i will think twice to go there again. I appreciate their concept of making a cafe with a nice scenery in the evening. They have some chairs and tables in the yard. So you can have chit chat either with your friends or your boyfriend/girlfriend. I like one of the menu, banana nugget. However, the serious point is that i think the menu are overprice for some ppl like me. Also, they dont offer various menu to be selected.

Cant take a proper picture yet rest assured it was a nice place to hang out. However, i hope that there are more food options in the menu.

Great place to hangout with friends and family. A lil bit cold at night because it's semi outdoor place, don't forget to bring your jacket or warm suit. Super cozy atmosphere!

Surprised to see the very spacious area of this cafe. I like their cozy setting, plenty of seating options, and the playlist, wifi, and electrical socket are suitable to do some work.

Price is very affordable, and their matcha tastes quite good.

One of my favorite place to hangout. Cafe with Scandinavian concept design. The food and coffee is good, i love their lasagna, super duper mouth watering! Big portion with affordable price. Now they also served pastry, pretzel, sourdough etc. The place is clean, nice place for work or just hangout with friends. There are outdoor and indoor area. The outdoor area is so comfy with pool and coffee table with chair, while the indoor area is bright, clean and cozy. The toilet is big and clean.

I really like this place, definitely would come back and be my choice to spend my time to leisure or working. This restaurant concept is Scandinavian themed, from the design, language, choice of food on the menu, and anything in it.

The taste of their food especially the fried rice is excellent, very tasty and lot of beef. The drink is also good. The snacks i bought, french fries, is also good on the sauce. Tha price is fair with the taste and quality. The place overall is also good and well built.

There are plenty of seat, outdoor, indoor, either on first or second floor. Lot of facility is available, toilet, musholla, valet parking for car, etc. The staff is also friendly and kind, and their service is made me satisfied. There's also live music on weekdays night if I'm not mistaken. They also sell bread here, so there's a bakery or patisserie in here.

went here for brunch and it was perfect. The place was great, every single spot is absolutely instagram worthy. Various menu from snacks, desserts and drinks and they're ALL so pretty. Most of the customers come with their friends or family. Or you can just go by yourself, doing some online task from laptop while enjoying some of their snacks

It's a little bit crowded in the weekend, but still can enjoy the good atmosphere. You can enjoy a life music here.

Quite famous place, quick fast food good for night snack. Has many lesehan area for hangouts. So many ketan variation. The one with brown sugar kind of tastes of pecel, which is so unique.

The place is normal. Only name wins. The taste is also ordinary. The one in Batu Square has never been tried because it is too crowded, the place is narrow and the queue is long. After I tried, I prefer the angsle in front of the Malang temple hahahha. The price is quite expensive for a very small plate size. The STMJ also tastes normal and has a little taste of raw milk.

I really like this food! Ordered with chocolate and cheese variant and the taste is really good. Combined with ginger milk and all is perfect ! I planned to visit the store in city plaza in Batu but the queue was so long.

The only decent food is the ketan. They give the durian topping as a whole durian (two pieces tho). The teh tarik was awful. The mochaccino was bad. The service was fine. The place was too crowded.

Cozy little cafe. Their pancake and waffle are so yum! Been coming back here again and again for sweet treats

Try another branch of Demandailing Cafe, and now I try different menu. I ordered scotch egg with vegetable curry, and it was tasty as always! Such a great style of eggs and I like it!

1. Hidden Gems Coffee Shop.
Well, for the first time I was really surprise with this coffee shop. To find it you should come to the small alley that only fit with one car. But when you arrive at the cafe you would gonna love it.
2. The design.
They are actually very homy coffee shop. You would gonna find a lot of tree, plant flower, green grass & cat. The architecture of this cafe is like a open space home which is very cozy. They have indoor area & outdoor area.
3. The Food & Drink.
Well they are really good at coffee. I think owner this cafe really understand about coffee. They have V60, tubruk, french press and other method coffee brewing & also they are really carefully choose the coffee bean they use.
They only serf the best coffee bean (Arabica /Robusta) for customer.
4. The Man Power.
They have three barista and all the barista very friendly, smart, diligent & helpful.
They work very fast to serve drink / snack. They are actually pretty skill full and know about how to make a best coffee.
I was order Aceh Gayo with V60 method and the barista (name Iqbal) give me the delicious extraction that masterfully balance flavour clarity & satisfying body. Good job üëç .
5. The Price.
Well the price is very affordable, best of the best of the town compare to the other coffee shop in Kediri.
6. What make this coffee shop is special because the power of ""social interaction"" . Every body that visit this place is talking each other, sometime they play game (Chess, uno or poker) and you will hear laugh & smile on their face. It is very good, mean human interaction create a good ambience.
7. Now Kopicab become my second home, every weekend I always visit this place, and I would absolutely recommend this place for you to visit.

Coffee taste decent. Too bad they have a very limited options for food. But still a good option if you want to escape the city loud noise.

Lovely and quiet place. The staffs are friendly, the price is affordable. You should try their Es Rempah.

They make you feel's like home!  Quite place for escape from crowd for a moment.  They also will serve you with a nice coffee,  sweet smile and with happiness.

It's a very refreshing place. With bamboo trees at the side of this ""Tiny House"",  located at shaded place, this Coffee Shop, certainly could make you relax. Furthermore, they serve a great quality of coffee (oh, and there's chocolate too). The hospitality from the owner, too, makes this place a great place to go. Make your moments in here!

The usual milk coffee is fine though I must say the americano is very smooth, not bitter at all, no burn taste, a bit more on the creamy side, I do believe it's going to suit a lot of people.
Very clean interior, tables and chairs neatly arranged and doesn't make it feel cramped even if it isn't the most spacious. No restroom though, keep that in mind when buying seconds.

Cozy place, the beverage is quite cheap and delicious, and they got couple of board games that you and your friends can play together. Some book's are available to read also.

Simple yet elegant place even though it is a little bit cramped. It's designed for groups after all. Two places for our coffee, inside the building; which a cold place with 1 long table and several 2 seaters, and outside near the sidewalk with 3 seaters.

Famous with their Palm Sugar milk and coffee with the price range around 12-21K. To add, delicious and soft butter croissant for only 5K.
We can choose between hot or cold.

They have games too: Truth/Dare, UNO, Jenga, Monopoly, and surprisingly Congklak.

A nice place to stop by and grab some afternoon cofee. Very affordable menus as it is situated within the Universitas Brawijaya's campus, where it is becoming very popular among them. They have a good choice of local coffee, as well as various refreshments and good meals. I have ordered a plate of hotdog and the veggies freshness truly amazed me off. Good for group, good for self, but just remember to avoid the rush hour.

Located on Brawijaya campus, but not only for students.
Perfect place to study or chill, with an amazing quality of coffee.
Lunch and dinner is also possible, a little bit european style, as well as local dishes.

Definitely recommended!

On the picture, you can see a grill chicken ceasar salad, prepared with less fat and souce on the side!

The place, for it's part of UB, is quite comfortable to hang out in. It has prayer room (musholla) and restroom available for the guests. I guess the menu has been changed since the first time I visited the place. I think, some food are somewhat pricey. The chicken salad is great, so is the tomyam soup. But the snacks are overpriced since they, in my opinion, are far from satisfying.

Oh wow, what a hidden gem I found here in Malang.
I love their concept, it felt like you're visiting your frineds house and hanging out at their garden. The place is not crowded, the vibes are chill and the drinks are great. They provide a great coffee beans here, and the capucino were great! my fave!,
I tried some of their snacks as well, and Inlike the avocados one, surprisingly good, but I think they could only served several sets per day.

Also the Leuchtfeuer Coffee Costa Rica for the manual brew

Thank you for the experience and best wishes for Roewang Tamoe Coffee

Not exactly sure what is the hype, I know this place from social media and when I was there, sure the coffee is quite good. There are some bread and pastries which seems good.

The one that got my bad side was, since this place is in residential area there were some snack vendors going around the block. When I tried to buy snack from vendor (the coffee shop didnt have this snack and I was still buying their coffee and snacks) they straight up forbid me. I understand there is a ""no food from outside"" rule, but there were no other costomer inside and I always clean up before myself.

The ultimate feature of this cafe is the ambience. Industrial style interior with chilling jazz/lounge background music creates cozy mood. You can talk, read, day dreaming with this setting.

Apparently the food is made with good ingredients; resulting good presentation. But the taste is so-so compared to the price.

The place is strategically positioned with easy access to main street. You can have a meeting in central Surabaya. Be advised that the main street usually jammed due to rush hour around 5 to 6 pm.

Super cozy place. I spend hours working and very comfortable here. Price wise is really worth it. Ordered the green tea latte only for 45k but taste super great. And nuttella croisant only for 35k.

great place to hang out, eat and drink with friends. Cozy and clean.Above average than other hangout places in the city of Malang, the price offered is still affordable ranging from Rp. 20,000 to Rp. 45,000 depending on the food you choose.there are indoor and outdoor places, complete with prayer rooms.

came here because one of my friend suggested to try this place. it was good. the ambience was the typical coffee shop with bustling sounds of people hanging out with their friends or clacking sounds of people working from the cafe. the food came out good, but not that tasty. the food was a bit expensive, if I must say.

AADK is a high class concept! One of the best cafe where keeps an indoor and outdoor area. The ambience of the first floor is very suitable to create a warm friendship, sharing love and laugh. There's a photobox there and every corner is so instagramable. The atmosphere of the second floor is really appropriate to engage communication and find solution. There's a space to be a workplace and having intense conversation. The service is good, the menu is also unquestionable, and the price is normal and affordable.

This cafe is spacious, there‚Äôre a lot of tables. Foods are so so but it‚Äôs served in rather big size for my preference (the mashed potato especially), and coffee‚Äôs quite good. I gave 3/5 stars because there were flies in the indoor areaüòì They should do better job at cleaning.

I will review the mushola and the toilet

So the musholla is great, it is so vast and very comfortable, i will give an extra point for its cleanliness as well

The bathroom is great, but they put a lot of stuffs inside.

But overall it is really proper for sure

I was going to have some coffees and snacks to be taken away with me, but somehow it did not provide take-away option but only with my own tumblers or meal boxes. Which I appreciated that means the owner wants to encourages their customers to reduce single use package or enviromental concsious awareness.
With regards, generally I often have to remind the waiters at cafes to not put plastic straws in my drinks.
Other great news about this cute hidden coffee shop are student friendly price ( 15k for hot or cold manual brewed coffee selection, no adding taxes and I did not see a tip box at the cashier), quiet enough to enjoy your books or do your works, or just hangout have a chit chat with friends.
Expect to come here on motorbikes, the parking spot relatively small.
Staffs were friendly, helpful, and quick witted to orders.
Its menus are simple yet efficiently made to serve, come with unique names but provide explanation below.
One down side thing was the bathroom was out of order which came with quite funny notification said can pee but not other duties.
It might or might not be a bummer, since coffees are naturally diuretic.
Afterall, I personally think my coffee was great, and would like to come back again.

Good ambience for coffee and book lovers. Located in the middle of village of northern Yogyakarta. Suitable for seeking inspiration while you are drinking coffee and listening to the good music. Love it.

Coffee shop friendly for backpacker and book addict. Lest try it ‚ú®

It's quite a nice place and easy to find. It's best to visit the place in the evening, since it's usually a lot of visitors haven't come and you can enjoy the quality time at the time.

Reasonable prices...

Overall it‚Äôs a nice place to work, study, or even organization meeting since a lot of student come to this place for that.

The only minus two are the parking area is kinda small and the place is kinda hot although the ambience looks nice

Homey coffee shop just located in housing area. Feels like you drink your coffee inside your own house, even there's a shower in the toilet. There are three spot you can choose here, first is outside in front of the carport, second is inside the house and the third its gonna be the little back yard. The decoration pretty nice, and lovely. About the drinks and beverages, obviously there are a coffee based and non coffee based. I ordered a brahma which is like cranberry with a tonic water i belive, and its really refreshing.

Very cozy coffee shop. The architecture of the room is also very nice. Coupled with room knick-knacks. Very good and amazing. The dishes served are also varied. Ranging from hot to cold there are also. Books are also provided for bookworms. The place is clean. Very good and. Highly recommended for students, colleagues and others.

The place is nice, quiet, good for chatting and not noisy music because my concept is indeed a house made for a shop, but the number of seats is still modest but the menu and drinks are not inferior to other coffee shops. What's more, it's open 24 hours to hang out with your santuy, supported by classic decorations and poetry rhymes that can be the theme of conversation in the midst of gaps

The baristas are nice, sexy and nice to chat with.

Wifine banter...

Drinking coffee at this shop feels like drinking coffee at a friend's house. Complete with chatter, chirps, splits, and snacks.

With a very affordable price, you could say the price of a friend, this coffee shop is worth a visit. Filter coffee/filter milk coffee which is Bung Andi's signature is also worth a try. The combination of coffee and milk is just right. Oh yeah, don't occasionally order anything, because the price is expensive ü§£

Open from 6 am, so you can drink coffee early in the morning or drink coffee in the evening while relaxing after a full day's work.....

It's my first time hanging out there.
It's a nice place to hang out even though it's noon.
The atmosphere is shady, there are mango trees that are quite shady which makes it a nice place to hang out during the day. There is a toilet too.
Far from the crowd, meaning not disturbed by the sound of passing vehicles.
This place is good for chatting not for playing cellphone games.

My son n I ordered big breaky n good morning Melbourne. The meals were delicious, scrambled eggs were soft n well seasoned. The croissant was crunchy, my son said his meal was perfect. We were given a free dessert, it's good but for me the waffle was a bit too sweet. I like the vanilla ice cream

Lovely place indeed. I really love the clean, white, minimalist yet cozy interior.

They have a spacious indoor and outdoor area. But there aren't many power sockets tho, kinda annoying. But then again, maybe this place isn't suitable for work? Idk.

You can get to this place because you got lost following the gmaps, so stop by. As for the place, it's quite easy to reach, the weather is cool, the cafe design is okay.
But apologize in advance, my honest review of the price is not suitable for students. The menu was less varied and I was confused about choosing a menu because my stomach didn't go well with coffee and chocolate. As a result, I ordered chocolate ice & baso aci. Baso aci at a price of 20 thousand that I ordered was too expensive because it wasn't worth the filling. But the chocolate ice is pretty good.
It is hoped that my review can be used as a consideration for evaluating this cafe so that in the future it can grow & be even better. Success alwaysüëåüèª

Cozy place. Cool, not noisy. Suitable for refreshing. Suitable for family events.

Nice place, open spot because it uses glass, easy access, right around the corner.

Delicious coffee, friendly seller... this lanang coffee shop is located on Jalan Mataram, west side of the road (next to Bu Amin's food stall).

There are a variety of hot and cold coffee offerings, such as black coffee, coconut milk coffee, palm sugar coffee. The price is pocket friendly.

The shop opening hours are written from 12 noon to 1 in the morning. However, this coffee shop usually opens after 3 pm. This is because the seller is alone and needs time to rest enough and provide selling materials. The closing time is always at 1pm.

Had moved locations that were all in the south shifted to the north and which is now including the third time moving locations. 22 years hanging out here, only the generation of visitors is different, but there are also some old visitors who are still regular customers until now. The favorite menu is fried egg noodles using cheese and given a little gravy. Favorite drinks are still happy soda and iced coffee and milk. In the afternoon, it turns out that it is now being used as a place for storing motorbikes for the children of Sman 1 Blora. There are also many cafes around there

On Sunday evenings it's really crowded, but it's really suitable for hanging out casually eating indomie ahahahaha. Apart from that there are many other snacks ranging from toast, french fries, nuggets etc. The price is also still affordable, no need to be afraid to make dry bags. The seats are cross-legged, there is wifi so that you feel more comfortable hanging out. The place is in an alley but still easy to find.

Wow, this is a high school hangout place. It's perfect for nostalgia... The fried noodles are a winner. Now there are a lot of menus. The place is cool, sitting on the floor. Open it until night anyway. It's really good for hanging out especially when you're hungry in the middle of the night... The service is sat set... cool

Cheap prices and spacious place to fit many people. There are lots of menus with fried indomie and Godok in various flavors. The location is a bit deep but can still be found easily. Most Blora people know this place. suitable for hanging out with friends and girlfriends.

Best coffee shop to study, work, doing your thesis. They have smoking and non smoking area, but i prefer the non smoking one. Love their playlist, not too crowded and looove their selection of beans and filtered coffee, their iced latte and green tea are also a good option!

Good atmosphere and very comfortable. Lots of charging station available, both inside and outside. Great coffee, but not so much option available, the price is standard. If you are looking for a place to do your work I recommend this place

The resto is not big. Cozy enough for friends and family to hang out for coffee or big meals.
We ordered Asian chicken curry, calamari rice, fish n fries. Delicious üëçüèΩ The mashed potato was savory and the consistency is just right. Not too soft.
The food presentation is also very nice.
The lime drink is served in a large jug, unlike some resto we visited before. Very generous portion, not too much ice cubes.

The interior is vintage. There is a collection of motorcycles in front of the main entrance. It‚Äôs nice to see if you‚Äôre into bikers. But, I think it took up too much space. The outdoor area has only 2 sets of tables. We chose outdoor because the non-smoking area is not available.

It was our first time and we got a pouch of signature coffee powder for free because we spent more than 250k.
Thank you, Vosco Coffee!

A very comfortable place to just relax or hanging out with bunch of friends accompanied by a delicious cup of coffee. Coffee is good. Food just too pricey. This place differentiates rooms between smokers and non-smokers, this place also provides an IQOS corner.

A comfortable and good place to have a chit chat with your friends in Malang, the coffee and other beverages and also the desserts are all delicious with reasonable price. Though the parking space is not large but overall it's a nice modern coffee shop in town. Inside you may take pictures in interesting spots that have motocycles on display.

Vosco coffee is amazing! The staff. is friendly, the coffee is really good. They have their own coffee bean products. Ambience is nice and cozy, the dish is quite delicious, they have single origin coffee and brewed by the professionals. It's really recommended for coffee lover when visit Malang city.

For a comfortable, cozy place, it's nice to relax and be more elegant. There is a meeting room too.

To drink it, I ordered the V60, for the initial taste, the balance is okay, but after the taste, it still bothers your throat. It's okay, practice more, mas and miss barista.

Dizzy Coffee.. French Fries IDR 10,000 But PORTIONS ARE MALANG RAYA CHAMPIONS

Wow, I never thought that in the Ciliwung area, Malang, there is really good coffee..

Product: I ordered Es Coffee Coconut, it tasted really good... my friend, who doesn't like coffee that much, took a sip and immediately said ""mmmm yummmm"". That means it's really good because my friend is the most fussy about food and drink.

Price: the price is standard but in accordance with the taste. The price for Ice Coffee Coconut is only IDR 18,000, guys.. French fries are only IDR 10,000 but the portion, Masha Allah, is a lot, guys, and the taste is really good too...

Place: even though I ordered take away but at first glance I saw that the place was quite comfortable for hanging out... and the location is on the side of the road so it's really easy to find.

Service: friendly service, even though I came with flip flops and all black clothes..

Please, those who miss good coffee can immediately attack the place....

The drinks are great

The place is difficult to find a car park. Very roadside location.

For the price, it's still above the lower limit for cafe prices in Malang, yes, but it's worth it because the place is good, bro, the coffee is also good. Price range if I'm not mistaken 15k-30s

The atmosphere is calm even though the roadside is a bit congested and almost always crowded, especially near gacoan, you know how to do gacoan for yourself

The only minus is the space, which is not too big and not too small, while the plus is that there is an individual seat facing the wall. The seats are actually proportional to the overall space, but I personally think it's a bit too small.

The majority of seats are outdoor, indoor non smoking only 1 seat set, I guess.

The service is a little above standard which is good because the standard is actually already good. If you pay using QRIS (QR Code), the qr code is printed specifically for customer transactions, so you don't need to enter a nominal again like in most cafes today.

-Tea Bar Leaves-

Bored with hanging out at the coffee shop, so you can shift to the tea shop. The tea here is not just any tea. The taste is very unique, it is made directly so it is guaranteed to taste fresh and distinctive. You can really request if you want sweet or sour. The price is also very affordable, from 15-25 depending on the taste variant. The stock is also sometimes empty, yes, because the seller is deliberately possible so that the original taste doesn't disappear and disappoints.

For me, who is enjoying tea for the first time, it's delicious, isn't it? Friendly and polite service. Parking is good for motorbikes. There are indoor and outdoor. Very close to the highway. Comfortable seating both inside and out. Toilets are also clean. It's cool to just sit and enjoy tea alone or with friends and family.

Thirst savior drink with various variants of processed tea and fruit drinks.

In my opinion, the most recommended are Jasmine Hibiscus and their Mogu-Mogu Tea. So refreshing!

For very limited food choices, I had time to try boiled instant noodles which was quite disappointing, because it was really just boiled noodles and eggs. For a class of contemporary cafes, the food presentation is very standard with the prices offered. The staff is friendly, and very helpful. Overall this cafe is comfortable, but needs some input for the menu offered.

Nice and calm atmosphere, the coffee is also good, the barista gives input according to what I want. The best chocolate! My kids love chocolate and cookies & cream.

Ete shop. It is a hangout place that is different from the others.

cozy cafe, perfect for chatting, doing assignments. there are 2 levels. the bottom one can make tasks and nuances quieter. If the upper level is for those who like to be crowded because the sound of vehicles on the road is very clear, so it's suitable for those who just relax.
the food is delicious, suitable for those who like salty‚úåÔ∏è and spicy. the drinks are coffee and tea based, overall the drinks are delicious. prices are cheap

The place is nice, the atmosphere is cool and calm, strategic too, it's easy if you look for the right side of the highway. Good food and drinks, friendly prices. It's really good for hangouts or organizational meetings, there's even an interesting promo for organizational friends if you want to have a meeting here.. this would be a recommended place..

A nice place to hang out while enjoying coffee, there are two floors, I prefer to sit on the top floor watching the traffic which is never quiet, sometimes there is life music too. For simple food, because this cafe is marketed by students, the price is also relatively cheap.

Nice clean place although not too big. Easy access to the side of the road, even though from the main road it doesn't look too much like an ordinary shophouse, later there are stairs below for access to nongki & to the swimming pool for the children. The view of the rice fields really likes it if there is a cafe with a view of nature that can be used for healing. Drinks & food are pretty standard prices from 10 thousand-25 thousand. The snack menu has a few choices, try adding union rings, chocolate cheese bananas, crispy tofu, medoan tempeh or cheese cassava. There is no VAT at this time. It's just a shame it opens at 3 in the afternoon. Lack of promotion on social media too. Try near the swimming pool, give a table and chairs with umbrellas like that üëç.

The coffee is ok. There is no place to eat/drink on the spot. There is one on the side with a roof, but when I went there during the day it was really dark. The chairs in front of the shop were also compacted, maybe because of covid.

At that time the breads were no longer in the display area, so all that was left was the drinks. The delicious milk coffee with rum (forgot the name). Coldbrew Robusta is pretty good too.

What's worse is that the shopkeeper doesn't wear a mask..... even when making and serving drinks. So it's a bit ilfeel. Even though I'm not afraid of Covid, that's not the case either. There still has to be a health protocol. For shop owners please tighten again.

Very friendly service. Food hygiene is also maintained, as evidenced by the spoons wrapped in plastic for each food ordered. There is free WiFi too.

The food is delicious and definitely halal. The price is also in accordance with the taste offered. There's even a promo so it's cheaper. Super like the drink :)

For a comfortable atmosphere, you can choose to sit in a chair (1st floor) or cross-legged (2nd floor). Only when I went to the 1st floor, the table was a bit wobbly, so it wasn't comfortable. Maybe it can be fixed...

The first time I came here, the impression was that the design was unique, good. The first husband chose Balinese coffee and Toraja but it was empty. Finally choose Lampung coffee. But, the taste is not bad. The service is really top. All friendly service. Get free french fries. thank you

The place is small but comfortable especially for waiting in line, or flash bites between patient shifts.

The decoration of the room is cool, utilizing the corner space on the 2nd floor. The furniture is also a combination of classic and modern which really blends together.

But what's a bit annoying is actually the barista might be even cooler if you use a barista apron with the cafe branding. Because several times the barista came here wearing the UMM Hospital employee uniform batik. So it kind of loses the feel of the cafe a bit üòÖ

For the menu, I like caramel macchiato the most. The sweetness is just right, a little sweet, but still safe, not as sweet as in cafes in general.

Overall recommended for hospital visitors or patient caretakers

I said quite unique, why unique?
This cafe is located on the second floor of the Malang Muhammadiyah university general hospital, a quite comfortable cafe..

The decoration theme's interesting.

We ordered mendoan and chicken rice. For the drinks we chose the iced coffee and iced yuja tea. The yuja tea portion is a bit small, but it served beautifully.

The mendoan tasted bland, so it needed to be dipped into the sauce. It'd be good to add salt a little. However the portions were a lot, which perfect for hangout snacks.

For the chicken rice, it tasted fine. I tried it a bite and I liked it.

The place is overall good, but there were mosquitos in the indoor seating. Maybe because we came there at late afternoon.

The staff gave survey form to be fill out. That's good for their improvement.

Excellent place to hang out and not too crowd, they have some board games you can borrow wjile you were waiting for your dishes. The special chicken menu is very nice and worth the price. Fried banana is meh but the waffle is good (nice combination with the sweet ice cream).

You can choose between the building, rooftop or garden area. Tbh i enjot the atmosphere even there are some problem with the cats (not really mind it but i cant eat very peacefully haha). They also have a live music session until 9.45 pm.

Kancane's yuzu ice tea is delicious and very fresh, highly recommend. Jogja does not lack cool places to hang out  each offers its specialty.

The choice this time is to try hanging out in kancane. From a friend's recommendation, he said this place offers good tea. Check google map, see the review, then cuss! curious. it's not difficult to find a place (you just have to follow the google map and it's ok)

I already think this place is going to be really cool, by the time I reach their patking space. When you enter the room you are greeted with vintage style, You see chairs with colorful nets plus old school tables, combined with a cool modern bar too.

Ordered their special tea, immediately ordered yuzu ice tea (Jogja happened to be a bit hot at that time) and a snack platter for snacking while working on projects and online meetings.

When I sip its Yuzu Ice Tea, it makes me feel fresh like that. It feels really good, very refreshing! Green tea blends with yuzu oranges so it's sweet, fresh, really delicious. Just add it right away, don't wait for it to run out!

For those who are in Jogja or on vacation to Jogja, you have to go to Kancane, not far from Hyatt Monjali anyway. The parking lot is also very wide.

Everything are perfect for this cafe. Actually, it's more like a co-working space than a cafe. Every spots has their own themes with their own multiple electric sockets. The vibes are just cozy to open your laptops. Or hangout with friends and play scrabble. The food was ok. The drinks was great. The outdoor space was spacious and shady with many trees. The location itself has several co-working spaces too.

They have tropical-industrial decoration, really like cafes in Canggu, and the coconut tree there really fits with the vibe. They sell mainly non-alcoholic drinks, but they provide cold beers as well. Kinda pricey if it's compared with any other cafe in Malang, but still reasonable. Definitely a must visit if you have an occasion in Malang.

Good vibes cafe. The only constraint is hard to fine car parking here. So my suggestion if you wanted to come here, just bring motorcycle or public transportation.

Plus point for their nice, quiet and cozy ambience. But not a fan for what they serve. Coffee taste not so good, and their mashed potato is bland with no creamy taste at all. Or maybe I just pick the wrong dish? Improve your dishes and drink, and maybe I'll consider another visit.

Will definitely be my favourite coffee shop in Malang. The coffee is superb! Try pour over V60 Gayo wine beans. Sooo light and clear. And surprisingly, it's not really expensive for such a fragrant and tasty coffee. The place? So much greeny and peaceful. It's got a concept a vintage house. A house during Dutch colonization.

Atmosphere ok strategic lovation but sometimes too noisy due to semi open air and the traffic but the menu, taste and variety are good

A great place to hang out with friends and family! Food and beverages vary, the price range from 20-50 thousand rupiah. At that time I ate fish and chips and green tea, it tastes good and quite filling. Because it is located at a crossroads, so the view is pretty good. There was live music too until about 11pm, and it was very entertaining.

The place is nice, cozy, and clean. The menus are affordable and taste really good, although it may take some time (30-45 minutes) per menu to be served. It's a good place for having online work/class, or even family gatherings

Nice place to havr a dinner..they offer some kind of traditional food and drinks.. i ordered Jahe kencur gula merah, alang2 tea with rosella, rawon blonceng and noodle. Im so happy to find they serve the drinks with the real herbs fulfilling the glass..looks so authentic and traditional..i like the alang2tea with rosella at the most, the scent and taste is so refreshing and healty feels..

Hello Coffee lover

This is a place you have to visit, why?

1. the place is very cozy
2. good drink of course
3. good coffee
4. an okay price for a cafe in the middle of the city

If I feel good in the morning here, it's not too crowded.  Can do assignments or can think of work or can also think of something else.

The minus is the lack of parking especially for those who bring a car.
But there is a solution, you just have to go-taxi online

Enjoy yes

The interior is superb. It's cozy and warm. I prefer the indoors because the outdoors have too many mosquitos.

They have quite a variety of menus. From coffee to non coffee, teas, and foods. The price range varied started from 25k++.

The baristas are also nice, so that's a plus.

This is the place you are looking for work or study.

Good coffee! They have outdoor and indoor seating. The indoor seatings are comfortable to just chill or do tasks, while the outdoor seatings are more suitable for hangout with friends.

The staffs are good and helpful, the toilet is clean, and the prayer‚Äôs room is neat and clean (it provides a very fragrant prayer‚Äôs mat and prayer‚Äôs set).

My favorite beverage from this cafe is Milkshake. I didn't find a matcha milkshake for this cafe. When I was a college student, this cafe was always crowded but cozy and quiet.

I recommended Work From Cafe in this place. This cafe must maintain the furniture and interior, but for the taste always be lovely, for waitpersons must smile and be friendly to the customer. BTW, this cafe must pay attention to the plating.

Nice and cozy place and they have smoking (outdoor) and non-smoking (indoor) areas separated. Free Wi-fi and power outlets are available. I think the number of the tables is a little bit small, not surprising because the place is not big. Nevertheless, with the right and nice interiors and light, it feels spacious enough. They apply the new normal protocol so we found that some tables are not in used. I think the chair could be imrpoved, though. I certainly like it if it more comfortable, especially if I want to do my work in the place.
We tried the apple pie, which is part of the pastries displayed at the front counter. It was scrumptious, with the perfect crispy, flaky dough and the right sweetness and sourness of the apple filling. The caesar salad comes as a combination of lettuces, generous amount of grilled chicken, and a slice of garlic bread but with different dressing than the usual yellow caesar dressing I used to know. It uses some kind of mayonnaise combined with certain herbs and spices I think? Kinda tasted the parsley in the dressing somehow. It tasted nice and fresh.
The salted spicy tofu is good, although I prefer mine to be a little bit more salty. It comes with a separate sauce made of sweet soy sauce and chili flakes. The vegetables cream soup tasted good but the texture is somehow quite thick, reminds me of a very thick porridge instead of soup. They're certainly generous with the amount of the vegetables, however.
The chocolate+milk is quite nice, while the iced lemon tea is proved to be a hit for me (definitely want to order it again!). We're lucky enough to get a free ice cream waffle with minimum 100K rupiahs purchase (choose between chocolate, strawberry, or banana one). The strawberry waffle comes with strawberry ice cream, strawberry slices, strawberry jam, and whipped cream that I found very rare used in the waffle sold here in the city. The offer will last until the end of August, by the way.

This place is cozy and classy.

Their menu is tasteful but a little bit pricey. And I have a nasty experience the last time I visit, the men's toilet was unsteady and made a bad smell around the room. Hope they will fix it very soon.

In fact its location is in the middle of a village. You need to be very meticulous to find it. The house seems to be an old one, the one that hasn't gone through much renov. It is left almost as its original form. The furnishings are also vintage. The owner or the barrista, I am not sure which, is very friendly young man. I bought its signature, called Iced-Coffee Kane (delicious Iced-Coffee), which is creamy and strong.

One of the small local coffeeshop that makes me impressed. It's because their signature coffee taste differ from another coffeeshop in Malang. They are not only following the trend, but they pay attention to their quality. My favorite is Es Kopi Susu Kane, paired it with a freshly homemade donut. You have to try it.

'Drink coffee at home' is the concept of this place. Built in the barista/owner's own house, the ambience feels so homey, reminds me of my grandpa's home back in my hometown somehow. But still has a little touch of coffeeshop with a small bar in the corner. Has lots of coffee beans, from arabika to robusta. Tried their filtered tolu batak, latte, and es susu kopi (ice coffee milk), tasted good, made with manual machine. For a non coffee drinker, try the Galauincinno ice, their special recipe, a beverage made of milk, coffee, ice, and palm sugar! A unique one, but taste really good! Affordable price, from 5k to 20k.

You will never expect a coffee shop at a quite place like this, is really traditionally and vintage place with many kind of arabica and robusta coffee, you will be spoiled by the whole coffee things

They mainly sell alcoholic beverages, but don't worry, they also provide non alcoholic. Their cocktail was good, all drinks were good on my visit. Quite cheap, -+30k/cup for cocktail. Very recommended.

A brand new place in a center of Malang City, strategic place with easy road access.
Great place to hangout and drink with friends, it has very nice concept and decoration. You can feel really different ambience downstairs, makes you lost track in time. There will be no difference ambience between day and night, amazing isn't it? Not only they have very nice place, they also provide you with extraordinary food and drinks.

definitely not my usual kind of scene ü§£ i personally cant stand being there for too long since its placed underground and a lot of people smokes there, its very stuffy. the snack is great though and the drink is okay!

The cafe with downtown of Tokyo's vibes

The Place
The entrance soooooo small. I even passing the place twice to make sure of it.
So many LEDs to take a picture with. Great vibes
Unfortunately, not for people who come to chitchat with friends, because the music is too loud for me.

The Miso Ramen taste sooo good. The Drink also good and fancy.

The Price
Reasonable. You can get the fancy dish for around 20k-50k

The service is ok. The waiter and cashier are so friendly

i tried the cappucinno, they use arabica coffee for the espresso and it's good.

Been trying all their menus, and their signature just the best.

If you want to find a comfortable, homie coffee shop with no buzz crowded, this just the right place to go.

My favorite spot is in the corner next to their roasting room, on non smoking area or you even can called it coworking space. colokan dimana mana, banyak tanaman. Makanannya enak (they just opened their Aromatic Kitchen).

Nice industrial vibes and nice grounded coffee blend

One of the cafes in Suhat is located next to the Sahid Montana hotel.  This cafe is not too wide but very homey.  The table provided is enough for groups and alone.  The menu offered is interesting, tastes good and has many choices.  Chocolate and coffee based drinks are highly recommended.  For snacks I recommend churros and fries.  One thing that is a little annoying for me personally, sometimes too many people smoke, so the smoke gathers until the table and my clothes smell of cigarette smoke, for passive smokers like me, it's quite disturbing.  Maybe there needs to be another way and regulation to handle my complaint.  thanks.

First of all, nice interior concept, just like an old gold mining site. I drank their coldbrew and it tastes great, mild and fruity. Next time I'll go there, I'd love to enjoy my coldbrew without an ice cube, it might taste a lot better. Overall, as a newcomers, they offer a great Australian culture coffeeshop. You should go there.

Have been trying their several different menus and here's my top three so far:
1. Iced hojicha; it's creamy and thick, the flavour is quite deep, not overly sweetÔºçjust a perfect bittersweet combination
2. French fries with this yellow sauce and mozzarella (I forgot the actual name in the menu üòÇ); because cheese will never be wrong!
3. Beef kebab; the sauce is exceptional!

Unfortunately, I can't give any review about their coffee because tbh my body cannot 'cooperate' at all with any coffee intake, but I can still say this is a nice place to spend the time.

I feel horrible for leaving a bad review because the staff was really nice, but this place offers more of an aesthetic experience than good food. the food was horrible, the spaghetti bolognese was way too oily, the lasagna was too liquidy and oily (the meat looked like mashed potato), the mac and cheese was so bland that it tasted like you just boiled macaroni in a pot of milk and forgot to put any cheese or seasoning, the matcha didn‚Äôt taste like matcha at all. everything tasted so bad I couldn‚Äôt bring to finish anything that I ordered. the price is really cheap so I guess the quality makes sense, tho I‚Äôd rather pay a little bit more for a decent quality food. on the positive notes, the place is aesthetically pleasing, has an amazing and calm atmosphere and perfect for those who need to work on their assignments, and the staff are really nice and friendly. the place is perfect for working but not for eating",0.925,0.0219417588143345,0.5366849562901639,1731,"cafe, bavarian, menus, sit, quality, studyingworking, malioboro, wifi, bring, offers"

There is a room like private room for us who need doing homework and outdoor. I ordered rice bowl chicken skin and coffe latte. The taste of food is not good little (kurang pas), so I hope they can improve the taste in their food.

The coffee shop conceps is highly appreciated. Cozy, clean and silent place, good for study or other woks. The menu is standard coffee shop, more beverage than foods. Parking's lot available limited.

a two-story hidden spot in jakal; very humble and sweet.

it had minimum signs and looked very small from the outside. as i went in, i could see that they try to make use of their space as best as possible. the 1st floor, filled with music and the friendliest staff, could fit 8-10 people. the 2nd floor, however, was like entering a whole new place.

as i went up, the music got quieter and quieter, and it was almost silent when i reached the floor. it was truly like a library ‚Äî filled with books you could borrow and just the right amount of peace to read, study, and get things done. there were enough extension cords which made me stay there throughout the day.

i asked to order iced water at the register and was a bit surprised to find out it's free. the main courses were out of stock so i bought a donut. i believe they serve the donuts with random fillings and i got tiramisu. it was soft and chewy, the right amount of sweet.

i was also happy to see toilets available in every floor. they were very clean! them using metal straws was also a personal plus. the wifi was top notch, too. will definitely be one of my go-tos whenever i want to work and study!

loooove the ambiece especially the second floor. it's like you found a hidden paradise to read a book and it couldn't be more perfect bcos there is a small library there that you could actually lend the books! the barista had very friendly service, clean place, bright room (to study or read), there is indoor and outdoor area. prices are average. will definitely coming here again if i need some time alone but don't really wanna be alone.

Only sells some mixed variant of iced coffee. Tea fusion isn't gonna bring you anywhere but mint-berry-lemon squash. Too many milk added in chocolate.

Anyway this place offers a productive yet quiet (very) working space located at second floor. There's even a library installed at the side of the wall. A rather downside is its chair kinda uncomfortable, creaking here and there, while some of the tables are quite shaky. Hope they fix it.

Very clean toilet, that's a plus

Unfortunately no praying room for muslim, you'd have to go to some nearest gas station to do your daily prayer

I love the design of this cafe so much. It's so beautiful and very aesthetic for Instagram. The design concept is different from other cafes.

Overall, it was a pleasant experience dining out here. We orderes several dishes: Chicken Nanban, Meatball something and Matcha Kitkat Cake. For the drinks, we had Cappucino Caramel Crumble and Buttercookies Tea.
The foods taste great. I could tolerate the crunchiness of the chicken katsu, while the sauce completes it really well. It's savory and creamy.
The Meatball also kinda startled us because they use some kinda strawberry sauce. It's new for us. Surprisingly, its sourness and sweetness don't overpower the savory taste of the meatball and mashed potato.
For the dessert, I picked the matcha cake. I could really taste the matcha flavor out of it while its not being too sweet. I love it.
I'd probably revisit the place to try another cake on the selections.

Katamichi is 1 of the best and comfiest cafe in town. It's decoration is awesome and cute. Food and baverage here is delicious, you gonna find them cute and lovely as well.

The staff is just OK, not significantly Javanese friendly ü§≠üòÅ
They should just smile a little when taking order and serving the food. üôèüòá

Good vibes only... services kinda slow because it's near lebaran... places kinda far from the city center

Life changing. No exaggeration. I never eaten ""paru"" before and never liked organs. But my girlfriend introduced me to kopi sontoloyo's nasi paru and it really is very delicious. Now everytime i go to malang i'll spare a day to visit here to eat the nasi paru as well as take away some frozen one to bring back to Jakarta. It really is really good.

This place is good if you're hanging out with your friends. In my pov as an introvert, you're not going to enjoy your time alone here or intimate moment with your girlfriend. I had no prob with the drinks but it wasn't special either.

This place only serves drinks, mainly coffee based, and snacks. They offer lunch meals which you can't choose what to eat, they only cook one menu each day :D
I love the building interior, very comfortable inside though small, it's air-conditioned, so... It's well off.
There's also roofed-outdoor space which I think is also nice and comfortable... It's recommended üëç

The food is delicious with aesthetic arrangement and the drink is nice, comes in fairly cheap price start from IDR 30.000. The service is handy and excellent, the employees is kind. The interior and exterior design is artistic and aesthetic, feels like dining in home with family with cozy atmosphere. This place also has games like guitar, uno, and chess. This place also has free WiFi. Suitable for study and work, or if you just want to eat alone in cozy atmosphere. Gotta recommended this place.

Its located on a remote location, but okay

To be honest i didn't know (or probably never know) if i didn't accidently passed this cafe on my way back home. This cafe is pretty decent for  some remote area/place, it has some cozzy sensation thatvyou usually find on high end cafe on Jakarta or its surrounding. Overall this place have all you need for a stereotype cafe.

The only minus that i'm aware of is the location and place. The first, as i already mentioned it's located on a remote area so it will be hard to find for ordinary people. The second one, although just because someplace located on a remote area doesn't mean the place is definitely small and doesn't have enough parking lot, but on this occasion its is. It will be very difficult if you planned to go into this cafe with a car, because there is no dedicated parking lot for car and even if you planned to go with motorcycle, make sure you go with an single motorcycle if you want park on this cafe.

But after all, this place is overally good if you put aside the location an vehicle problem and just i said before, this place have all you need for a stereotype cafe.

The first time i went to Sang Kudo, i was amazed with the place. From the outside it looks like some expensive cafes but once i see the menu, the prices are somehow cheap and not as expensive as i imagine it would be. I really love the vibe, the place is very beautiful, I'd say  Sang Kudo is one of the most beautiful cafe in Malang and Batu. I can't say anything about the food because the foods are as amazing as the place! Sang Kudo does not only sell vibes and comfy, but they also sell great foods! Sang Kudo also has fish pond and you can feed the fish too, really great for kids. Overall i'd say i had a great experience in Sang Kudo. Love 'em!

I went here twice. The first time I went with my sister. We ordered Horenso salad. It was so good, especially the sauce. It was sour, sweet and something that I can't describe. Also the veggies was so fresh.
I also ordered Chicken steak (for me, it was regular chicken steak) but the sauce was yummy and chicken pop. I am not recommended chicken pop. It was hard. Then, for drink I ordered Green Republic. I like it.
The second time ordered Chicken Fajitas. I think they have specialty in sauce. Again, the sauce was superb. I want more the sauceü•≤.
Last but not least was coffee latte. I don't like it. Just like reguler coffe latte that I made in home.
I didn't see if they have baby chair. Maybe you can asked them if you plan with your baby. I saw prayer place for Muslim and the toilet was cleaned.

If you have plan to Fertisoil I recommend the salad and Chicken Fajitas or something that has sauce. They have special sauces in their menu.

Presentation was good but maybe go for a late breakfast if you want all options. Lattes were good though.

My boyfriend and I drove a motorcycle from Kuta Beach to this place .  It's been a very long journey for me.  But it's worth it to eat amazing food.  very good music  I want everyone to try. The disadvantage is that there are no lights along the way.

We came here multiple times during our 2 month stay. Especially the la passion burger is delicious and well priced. The quinoa mushroom salad is a bit small for the price, but the taste is great. The volcano milkshake is a calory bomb - just what you want if you order it... Every wednesday is movie night once it becomes dark (best come there before 6)

I‚Äôve ordered the Green Superpower which was really good and creamy :). My daughter got a ham and cheese sandwich and although I don't appreciate to much that type of  the cheese that comes slides I did really appreciate what is the most important in a sandwich‚Ä¶ the bread‚Ä¶ very good brioche bred ‚Ä¶ I would pay more to have a better quality of cheese in this very very tasty bread üôà.
From Freakshakes, the Vulcano Rock very good if u want to forget about the calories that every shake comes with :))) ‚Ä¶ this one definitely will worth the extra gym day!
The pizza was good‚Ä¶ not your regular pizza dough (maybe because it‚Äôs a Mexican influenced restaurant) but still tasty and the fresh tomato side that we ordered separately‚Ä¶ was a very good one ‚Ä¶ tasted like a tomato and not plastic :)

We visited here twice in one day it was so good! We had a great lunch which tasted amazing and then visited again for some drinks in the evening.

An easy choice of coffee shop for those who needs a place to work from cafe! Clean places and plenty seat and power outlets for your time in front of laptop. It‚Äôs not as crowded as the other outlets so this one is better for me personally.

The newest Starbucks in town, and the first Starbucks which provides drive thru in Malang. If you want to dine-in, don't worry. It's really spacious. The location is not really difficult to find. Let's say it's in the main road in Malang.

The first Starbucks Drive Thru in town, the place is nice and cozy. Nice place to hanging out after office. There are indoor and outdoor area, both of them are cozy. Indoor area sometimes is too freezing because the air con is still new and works too well üòÖ The toilet is nice clean and smells good.

I order the package consisting of one coffee latte with a croissant, and I also order 1 berry soda juice.

All taste great and the croissants is really big.

For us to talk
And relax

So what are you waiting for
Please try

And this is my opinion

The location is easy to find thanks to the signage at its entrance. This caf√© uses halved demolished buildings, so don't expect fancy furniture and decoration. All seatings are considered outdoor, which unfortunately means, all are available for smoking area. The price in the menu is normal for Solo's standard. I tried green tea latte and it tasted good. I talked to one of the staff and he said the caf√© construction is in progress. Hopefully they'll have indoor non-smoking area in the future.

My only place to go when my car have a problem I believ since 2008. The service and hospitality is very nice. The staff is friendly and informative. They make sure that the old parts can be maintaned before the option goes to full change the parts. The price is proper and they try can done the service by end the service hour as long they not fully occupied. This place offer car paint with oven option so the result will closely to the original one. There is also the car wash and the price is not that pricy. There is also indoor waiting area with full AC.

Note for this place is only the entrance way because during the rainy season especially will have flood. So it is hard to pass by foot when you want to go out.

It is a really unpredictable eating resto. The entrance is a narrow alley, enough for one car, with slump area on both sides. And then we get into a abandoned look steel building. But unfortunately it is the parking area of the resto.
The facade of the resto is not inviting at all. But the delicious smell comes from it, and makes us wanna try. Just right when you come across the lobby, you will be surprise with lovely view. Comfy huts everywhere, outdoor seatings are arranged nicely, some even naturally made from stones and wood. Like it is not enough, it is surrounded by rice field in one side, and small lake at other side. Lovely greens and trees in the area make it more comfy. The view of surrounded rice fields with the skyscrapper building and giant electric tower at the far backgroun, with blue sky and lots of bird flying make the place more pretty.
The live music stage on the lake make it even more enjoyable.
The food it self is very delicious. The black pepper and butter sauce seasoning for the seafood are recommended. The sambal (traditional chili sauce) is very good. And importantly the price is in good range. Love it.

Very nice place for dining with family and friends, many choices on the menu. But better for lunch rather than dinner...cos mosquitos! Hidden quiet place behind a garage

A nice place to spend your weekend with family. You can spend hours here eating, chit chatting with friends and family while children can play at the playground.
Nice view and atmosphere. A great relaxing escape at Surabaya.

I came here for a light business meeting and immediately my attention was drawn to the industrial design that is different from other branches in Surabaya. I like the design and it gives combination of fine and rough style. Really love it!

The coffee is of course excellent and no accident at all. As you would have in the States or anywhere else. This is not going to give you a heart attack or tongue wash, it is the same everywhere even the prices.

The only draw back I can see it that, once you enroll into the membership, they know your name and do not play the name change game anymore. As a foreigner with an accent, they are trying very hard to make sure your name is right and becoming more serious, which for Javanese or Indonesia as a whole is understandable. I respect this.

I love Starbucks and I also notice that they seem to employee different interior designers to design each branch that makes exploration more fun and more enjoyable.

One of the best Starbucks, it's spacious, cozy, clean, the staff so friendly and helpful, we like sitting on 2 floor near big glass window to work or just chit-chat with family, we can plug in to charge our phone/laptop, we can use free wifi too, similar like in other shop in here serving good coffee and pastry, also sell merchandise and package coffee

Im very very sorry but i think starbucks nowadays are different from old days. It used to be good in old times.. But now.. not so good (standard for the drinks - and i did not buy food so i cant give any opinion for it )..

place still great to enjoy with friends. Service still good. But taste of the coffee. I think old times much better taste then now.

I think all sbux usually has same vibes, same price range. What I like about this sbux is they have two sbux and here has more spacious space, but the wifi kinda slow tho.

I ate here last night with my family. Located in the busy street of Kertajaya Indah. A pretty strategic area.

We ordered a rice bowl, 3 BBQ ribs, pretty pink, a peach smoothie, a cookies n cream and a cup of tea. All of them tasted delicious. I do love their BBQ ribs and peach smoothies.

A little downside is that they took around +-40 minutes to prepare for our BBQ ribs although from what we saw the cafe was not that crowded last night. Also, the narrow parking area is a bit of a problem.

Yet overall I'd recommend you to eat at Communal.

Nice place, good ambience, coffee taste great, friendly waiters..I enjoy the tripots (chips, wedges, fries). Additional fees for Tax 10% and service 5%

Wifi works fine

The first ever coffee shop that uses flair to extract espresso drinks.
The Barista (might be the owner) made exceptional coffee.
Japanese Iced Tea was refreshing still with a little boldness
The cappuccino was smooth and perfect amount of foam.
To come here we kind of need to turn around about twice because we could not find it. It was hidden. Trust your google maps. and walk around the neighbourhood fro few minutes you will find it. But the parking here was quite a headache because there was no parking space for a car.
Hopefully they find more success and I get to visit here again. One of my regret from last visit to Batu was I only got to visit this coffee chop once because we have to leave the next day.
One of the things I will be excited to visit next time I'm in Batu will be this coffee shop (abundaces of amusement park, not so much)

Great place to take a cup of coffee and spend your time with your friends.

The place is quite humble, and if you're into a garden tea time session, this place might work for you.

They have lots of tea variant and you might want to check the menu first before going here since you'll be confused in deciding on one. But don't be afraid to ask the staff for recommendations, they will make sure to choose the tea mix that suits your taste. You can even customize one :) The best thing is that you can have refills if you're ordering the hot tea, best if you want to relax for quite a while in their homey garden with cats loitering around.

.. i kind a surprised today i am not took daily dose of caffeine.. and still enjoying this  ""sometime"" good feeling... this place wasn't kind of the place you found as fancy, famous around town, or give vintage vibes (is that young people say today), and feeling nuisance when people wandering around.. but this place its give you idea what you need when you being or traped as a adult...some piece of feeling that, someday you need place to calm and drifting away with (only) your sweet memory.... its wasn't only mood they give to me ..is whole ""pack"", food, drink, warm and welcome attitude so you stoping being uneasy if you come in alone. is nice"" home"" feeling i found as a gems experient. i  give 20/10 if that kind of ratings (i hope) really existed.
one thing i learn today.. make costumers feeling enjoy more important rather than give good scenery or ""vintage vibes"" (is that young people say today).

First of all, the tea is nice, totally indescribable. They've got around 20 kinds of tea (after eliminating around 20 more), and my favourite is Wishing Well tea. Hondj√© 2 looks amazing as well. Also, I do love the way the owner (idk who, a woman) explained each tea for us, it shows that this place wasn't build for money only, but with enthusiasm and dedication.

However, what makes me put 1 star down is because of the place isn't well managed. I understand that it's a place for folks or indie peeps, but I hope the place to be somewhat cleaner and more organized. It is aesthetic enough, I do love the place, it's like the calmest corner in the hectic Soekarno Hatta, but it will be much much better to organise it more.

Gonna come back soon anyway. Already need to purchase more tea bags! ü§ó

But the ending becomes bad when food is served after 30 min of ordering, the chocolate milk shake super tasteless.... Just like a cup milk.
And the worst is that our velluto  gelato (65K per cup) contains sharp plastic pieces.  Staff within the bar also jokes around loudly with no regard toward customer's comfort. The one cooking (outside vendors) even  swore out loud when customers around.
Won't be eating here anymore.

I love the idea, the place, the food. Very open and nicely decorated, barn themed, natural materials. Very similar to Rustic Republic in Kediri, but the foods are way better here.

Lovely place

You know from a friend, I was a bit skeptical at first, sis, ""This is really the place to be?!?""
But it turns out, behind its appearance that looks like a warkop (and indeed a warkop wkwkwk), there is also providing delicious food, really awesome!!!!
The taste is great, nothing less, really more (beyond expectations, it's that delicious!!!)
The portion is just right, in my opinion, even though I only ordered a menu that used rice cake, it took a long time to fill up, and the side dishes weren't stingy at all (9 '-')9
Affordable, even cheaper, but not cheap wkwkwkwkwk
Just imagine, 11k creamy chicken!!! (usually I buy the 15k ehehehe, and I think it's already cheap, but it turns out there's something even cheaper!!!!)
The menu is not very varied, but everything is delicious + not boring (especially the food)
As for the drinks, there are lots of choices, the average is a sachet drink, but it's still delicious
Rarely hang out here, because...feel a bit unfriendly (very warkop vibes), but the food is super worth it!!!
That's why, usually the order is wrapped, but if you want to eat there too, actually just pw-pw yaa wkwkwk
The location is near campus, so the price is also very suitable for the budget of boarding students
Eat it on the spot or wrapped, it's both worth it, the taste doesn't change, and it's always warm :)
The packaging is also neat + the ladies and gentlemen who serve are super friendly wkwkwk
Hey guys, you can order via gojek-grab too

The scenery is breathtaking and complemented by skillfully prepared coffee beverages ranging from hot and cold serving.

Parking can be a challenge since this place is located up on the hill and going through the narrow entrance to the nearby dense suburban area, but it is still achievable when driving carefully and slowly.

Friendly staff and professionally trained to prepare the high-quality coffee beverages.

The cold Agregat coffee drink is good üëç
While the hit cappuccino drink is also perfectly mixed.

Well done team.

Street/gang lead to it are very challenging.
But paid by spectacular views.
Food can be improved. The burger bun is to thin at the bottom so it gets soggy from the sauces etc.
Waitresses  who seat incoming customers are sometimes friendly, sometimes not, depending on who seats who.
But servers were great & efficient.

on weekend: so full, get ready to be on waiting list.
on weekdays: quiet like you own the place.

food: not superb, but it's more than enough to match the atmosphere. Just set your expectation right.

serving time: surprisingly they are still able to serve relatively fast even on weekend with full table

The place offers spectacular view of the downtown, but the path leading to this place is very steep tho. Price is quite affordable: snack, coffee and other beverages are in the range of 20-35k, and the taste isnt that bad. The interior is so on point.

New cafe on alternative route Batu - Malang. The location is on the edge of onion and orange groves. The view is great from the cafe, especially when it's not cloudy. There are various drinks and snacks such as French fries etc. The orange ice and samosas are delicious. The place is nice, there are people who sit and cross-legged. Toilets are also available and motorbike parking is also available. Can't park the car yet.

It's a pretty good place, what else is there a choice of where to sit or sit on a chair. Then there are also plugs on each table, so if at any time the battery is low, all you have to do is plug in the charger. The location is also very strategic on the edge of the Batu Malang alternative road.
The menu is also quite complete, but the drawback is in the parking lot, for now there really isn't a car park, maybe next time there will be a car park.

Located on Jl. Alternative Malang - Batu. The menu is quite varied with affordable prices. Toilet is small but clean. There is a sitting table. The atmosphere is calm and comfortable because it is next to a garden.

The staffs were also very humble & kind, they were willing to share many details about taking care of dogs, dogs breeds, etc. I definitely will back here!

A place where you can play with 12 dogs (big and small size dogs). The dogs are all cute and easy to play with. The food was decent but takes very long to come out. The staff was very helpful. You can take pictures with the dogs and the staff will gladly help out. Will definitely come again.

LOVE PLACE BEST VIEWS

After not being here for a long time, I was surprised, it turned out that the cafe had been renovated in such a way. In the past this cafe was very simple with a sky roof and vines, now this cafe has turned into an aesthetic cafe with various ornaments. In the past, the outlets were only available at certain points, now the outlets are made evenly spread in almost every corner. The place is getting nicer and more comfortable, then the price is also still in the pocket of students. For the menu, then and now there have been many changes, even almost all of the menus are new menus. In the past, the heavy food menu was only indomie rice noodles, now the heavy food menu is quite varied and suitable to fill the stomach while enjoying the breeze in the afternoon. What I really miss about this place are the cute cats. There used to be a jet black village cat whose voice was very cute and made me miss. Yesterday when I visited again unfortunately did not meet the black cat. Really recommended this place

The place is comfortable. It is recommended to come here at night with friends. The most delicious place lesehannya.

One of the street boba outlets on the most iconic street in Surabaya, Jalan Tunjungan

The interior uses an industrialist concept where at some points it uses an unpainted cement facade which makes the minimalist concept very strong

Apart from that right next to it there is a Gildak outlet which uses an eye-catching interior concept that strong korean pop ambiance combines and makes both of them Instagrammable

Payment:
Cash, Debit, QR

This place is really clean and cute. It also follows the current health protocol quite well. I would recommend going here with your friends or family as it is instagramable-friendly and would be great as a hangout spot for youths and alike.

If you are to come here, I would recommend coming during mid-day as it is not so crowded at that time.

As for the price range, I would say it is mediumly price for its size. The small one is actually bigger than I expected and would I say it's worth it? It depends. The flavor of the drink I had was mediocre at best and was decently price for it. I don't regret it as I finished it in a single sitting.

In conclusion, a great hangout spot if you're in the area but just be prepared to spend a good amount of money for a drink that taste vaguely like something you've had before.

A new boba place in Surabaya. Location is so close to hotel Majapahit and Tunjungan Plaza (walking distance). There are indoor (quite big) and outdoor seating areas. Inside is so instagram worthy üòÅ Price of its boba is around IDR 24K. Not only drinks, it also serves donuts which cost around IDR 8000/ pc.

Really good bubble tea, the boba are chewy and tasty, the popping boba is also really delicious. None of that halfway cooked boba at all. Recommended!

I feel SYAHDU ATMOSPHERE when I enjoy poor coarse coffee at the shop which is located in this small alley.

Because the location is inaccessible to vehicles, it's better to park on the side of the main road or in the main square.

Arriving at the location, we can choose whether we want to sit on the available benches & tables, or take a stool (plastic chair) and find our own seat along the aisle.

Even though the price of the black brewed coffee is affordable (Rp. 4,000), the taste is very authentic. The coffee tastes thick, according to my taste.

Cafe with a very beautiful nuance, is perfect for being a place to calm the mind. The air in this Saungtani cafe is also fresh unlike in the city. Apart from that, the food and drink menu is also varied and what I like the most is the signature drink in this Saungtani cafe, namely Saungtani Batu Coffee.

Saungtani provides a relaxing atmosphere. Around Saungtani, there is still beautiful agricultural scenery. In Saungtani there is also a fish pond that can calm the mind. Apart from the surrounding scenery and the fish pond on the outside, the interior atmosphere of Saungtani is also quite comfortable. Sangtani provides a large enough space. Most of the chairs and tables are made of wood. The music presented by Saungtani is also quite comfortable for relaxed conditions.
The dishes and prices offered by Saungtani are quite friendly, pocket-friendly. As for the drink menu, apart from coffee, there are tea, chocolate and milk offerings. The food menu offered by Saungtani also varies, from snacks such as french fries, fried pentol, fried dumplings, to quite heavy meals such as instant noodles. The menu that I recommend when visiting this place is ginger milk. The ginger milk menu is perfect for drinking when in Saungtani. Apart from being healthy, this drink can also warm the body, considering that the temperature in the Saungtani area is relatively cold (because it is in a high area).
Saungtani parking area is quite wide. Saungtani also provides a rack to place a helmet so it doesn't get rained on or overheated.
The services provided by Saungtani are quite satisfactory.
The drawbacks of Saungtani (at the visit on 12 February 2021) is access to the toilet which is quite far away and has no roof. So, when we go to the toilet in the rain, we can get caught in the rain if we don't wear an umbrella or raincoat. The roof on the toilet was also found to be leaking. Hopefully this problem can be fixed at a later date.

Nice place.

The solution for relaxing coffee, doing assignments, and working in a very different atmosphere from the others! everything is semi outdoor with a nice breeze. the furniture uses used goods like the name of the shop, Lowak. of course still very comfortable.
the location is in the Joyosari area, for girls you know the Prabujaya clothing store, right in front of it. for guys, you know MakPar, it's close to MakPar.

uh for the price? Don't worry, it's guaranteed to be really affordable, starting at 6,000-14,000 (hopefully my memory isn't wrong). for sure it won't drain the bag even if you order it repeatedly hehe.

flavor? even though the place seems very simple, it feels like it can really compete. lots of unique ones like Lowak Ice, I think it's because everyone will have a different review hehe.

capacity? wuuu spacious place, often also for events. can accommodate up to 60 people.

the atmosphere of Warkop R. Basman is very interesting and unique, with a nice interior. In addition, there is also an outdoor area which provides a comfortable and beautiful atmosphere. Visitors can also enjoy views of the rice fields as seen from this cafe.

This Warkop also provides a varied menu of food and drinks that can be enjoyed at affordable prices. Apart from that, this cafe is also a great place to hang out with friends.

However, there are also some drawbacks to hangout wifi stalls. The noise and crowds that occur there can make it difficult for people to concentrate on doing assignments or reading books. In addition, this shop can also be a place that is less private because visitors can see each other's activities.

Overall, Basman's wifi hangout stall is a pleasant place to spend time while enjoying a cup of coffee and free internet. However, you should still pay attention to the time spent there and not spend too much time just relaxing.

This place seems nice, because when I came here it wasn't too crowded so it was relaxed to chat. There are also two cross-legged seats and seats. Suitable for poor people + students who want to hang out together

cool place to hang out, to spend time at night until late at night.
the menu is quite a lot, the price is also still affordable (rather cheap though).

This coffee shop is a brilliant idea. It combines a coffee shop and a library into one. This place is very suitable for studying, doing assignments, or just reading.

Nice ambience. Good food & coffee. Fair price

3 stars is too low but for 5 stars...Bhava definitely needs to work a lot more.

Having passed this place several times, I finally stepped in it last night.

Being seen from the road, Bhava seems cramped. In fact, it is a roomy corridor with warm lighting and nice match of colors. An array of 12 semi-industrial style table sets are neatly placed to accommodate couples or families indoor as well as 3 set for those who love it outdoor.

Having not so many items in the menu represents Bhava's dedication to the food taste and quality for customers' satisfaction.
Their food, indeed, indulge our tastebud surprisingly.

Yet, I have to be honest; serving speed is Bhava's weak point. While only one other table occupied by customers, a 30-minute wait for one of 4 meals in the order to appear is never good enough. If 4 of the tables are occupied by families simultaneously, the last to submit order may have to watch an empty table for 2 hours with growling tummy.
I believe this place can come up with better work rythm to compose more melodic eating experience.

drinking coffee, reading, discussing chatting to publishing books is possible, supported by UMKM TOKEN (blockchain waves), there is wifi too.

Local coffee 69 is highly recommended especially for friends who like coffee, the coffee here is very complete, the presentation is also unique. Not only coffee, there are also several traditional drinks available. What makes it even cooler, here we can drink coffee while reading books, because one of the owners is active in the publishing world. Books that have been published are displayed in the warkop to add an artistic impression. Not only books, here is also a gathering place for cyclists, many cyclists stop by for coffee when they are tired from cycling. the facilities here are also complete, for friends who like wifi, there is also wifi here üòÅ. The unique thing is that the menu prices here can be said to be below standard, very cheap, with the presentation and type of coffee that can be said to be of high quality, it is impossible for a coffee shop or cafe to sell a menu at the same price as local coffee 69. The only drawback may be promotion, the owner is not very active on social media, whereas in this technological era, social media is very effective for promotion.

The place is cozy to do some tasks or even to chill out with your friends. They got various menu of beverage and food with reasonable prices.

have spacious layout, complete choice area whether u want indoor or outdoor. i would recommend this place as it‚Äôs not as crowded compare with it‚Äôs surrounding caffes

and the food, since i haven‚Äôt found any different with other caffe/resto i‚Äôd love to say it‚Äôs another mainstream place in jogja.

it's a cozy place especially for studying and chit-chats, but the drink i ordered was a bit dissapointing. i had their ""bestselling"" caramel latte (kopi susu karamel). the syrup made my throat sore and i had to buy a bottle of mineral water, which would have bought anyway since the wifi can only be accessed through one device! they give you a specific username & password per purchase for it ‚Äî which made me at least go to the cashier twice (i wanted to use my laptop + phone). they also round up the prices to the nearest thousands after taxing 10%.

anyhow, the place was quite huge and both the outdoors & indoor area are clean. the toilet was as well but the locks aren't as secure as i had hoped. to sum it up, konkrite was a new experience for me and i'd keep a look out on more of their subtle tricks next time.

They have a fast internet connection! The first floor is nice to hang out with friends. The second floor is really quiet so it's a nice place to work and study. Affordable price for a good taste. You have to scan a qr code to see their menu. My favorite is definitely Matchaberryüòç
Their Potato wedges and cold brew coffee are great too!

I like this place. It is comfortable to do work. The food and beverages quite good. The price is also affordable for students.  It is clean and bright. If you go there at noon, somehow you'll feel hot inside so you may choose to be at the outdoor.

Food quality, coffee, price and service are ok. But the ambience of the place...
And the hygiene of the restroom... And the big empty building next to the restaurant...
And the parking space which looks abandoned and full of dried leaves...

If only the owner mind to make this place look more proper....

The place is awesome to hangout with friends and family. But the food taste is so average. I sit in the AC room but still so hot. The staff hospitality average too.

Here is my experience here. The waitress gave me the menu, i was waiting for another friends, so she said to call her when i'm ready. Look at the menu and tried to order, call her, she didn't response. I approached the bar to order, and mentioned my orders. But she asked me to go back to my seat cause she's still going to bring some food to other table. I had to pee, but I had to wait just to repeat my order. Oh and after I order, i tried to took picture from slr camera and they approached me and informed us that they require you to buy Rp 750k for taking pictures using SLR camera.
This whole place and only 1 server taking order and delivering food while the male server only come to tell us not to take photos, pizza came but no plate no fork, we had to ask for them and the servers weren't smiling either....I think with the price you guys should afford better service. There are better and friendlier cafes.
Update: finally some other servers came. I don't where they were but suddenly there are 4 or 5 more. I came @2pm and the servers spurges after 3.
So for me:
Food was: 5 stars

Service: 1 star

The coffee served at the coffee shop ""PORTAL COFFEE MALANG"" is coffee from the Malang region. There are Arabica coffees such as Arjuno, Kawi, Parangtedjo, and Selorejo Dau. Then there is Robusta coffee which is a mainstay, namely SRIDONORETNO (DAMPIT) coffee.

Previously, Portal Coffee Malang was one location with The Roots Barbershop Malang. But now the two have moved to separate locations near the old place. The most favorite here is of course the processed coffee. In the afternoon, visitors can also see the coffee roasting process for themselves. There are various types of robusta and arabica coffee beans on offer. Starting from Malang local products and several other areas. Good preparations include palm sugar milk coffee, brewed coffee, V60, afogato, and others. For those who don't like coffee, there are choices of traditional drinks such as wedang uwuh, nasi kencur and turmeric tamarind.

Cozy place, vibesnya hoomie bgttt

It's not too crowded, the service is friendly. The place is really okay. For the taste of food & drinks, maybe there will be more effort.

One of the good cafes for work.. every seat has an outlet too.. food and drink prices are quite affordable, there are indoor and outdoor seating options. Service is friendly and fast... tissue paper and hand washing soap are provided in the toilet... the toilet is also clean... the wifi is also smooth... good for assignments and discussions... but it's a bit noisy because it's near the highway. But overall it's worth it for a visit... Don't forget to ask for the wifi password... ohh every aesthetic seat can take photos

- The chicken tender rice for the sauce is too runny and bland, but the rice and chicken are delicious
- The matcha drink is too sweet and doesn't taste like the matcha, more to the sweet taste of the milk
- For service it was still lacking, at that time my order was not delivered to the table, I thought it was self service, but it turned out that there was a customer behind me whose order was delivered to his table, even though it was quiet at that time and the employee sat in front of the cashier and when he came home too play hp. Hopefully in the future there will be no customer exceptions.

Always trust your guts when it tells you not to visit some place. Once I ignored and I got this unpleasant experience. Place a bit fancy, but not with their food and beverages. Coffee's no good at all, and I got undercooked rice on my meal (and they took forever to served it). I didn't bother to complain because I was too exhausted. Definitely will not coming back.

New coffeeshop in town. I tried Cappuccino Royal (double shots capp) with 20k for the price and I would give 7,8/10 for the taste. The location was so strategic and kind of hectic to find a parking place, but not that hard. They have many menus with affordable price, and snacks. Also has 2 floors and their good services would made me to come back later!

Not bad, there were a lot of food and beverage options and they tasted quite decent for such a little place. Interior is excellent, however the only downside is the small parking area which can be pretty dangerous since it is close to the busy main road.

cozy and good coffee

The place is very comfortable clean and also seems simple not a fancy cafe. The coffee menu is very diverse and is also served from various coffee beans that we can choose for ourselves. For the price, it is still standard in the class of cafe cafes that sell contemporary coffee.

But yesterday when I ordered manual brew v60, the taste of the coffee was still lacking in my opinion, either because the coffee beans were not fresh, or something else that I didn't know.

Hopefully the owner of the teacher and also the barista will always improve their brewing skills, so that the quality and taste of the coffee will be better.

A friend recommended Awal Bermula Cafe and Eatery. At first I did not have much expectation, but after my visit I can say that it is a perfect spot to hang-out with friends, work on your computer or simply enjoy a plate of snack and drink.
Even though Awal Bermula is located on a busy street, across Pasar Blimbing, once you are inside, it is quiet. Their food and drink were okay (between 20-30K). It also has some seatings on the 2nd floor.
One major turn-off is parking. Parking space is tiny, fit two cars and two/three motorcycles or six motorcycles. Take ride-hailing service will save you from headache.

The beverages is good, the vibe in such a place is amazing for a dinner and chill time. Customer can enjoy the view from above to the road

The food was amazing. Yes, it was a bit expensive but the portion was quite large and the taste was an absolute wonder. The vibe was nice and cozy despite its minimalist space. Don't worry, it wasn't overcrowded.

I love their pizza the most, they were thin and not overpowering. The vegan one was my all time favorite.

The only downside of this cafe is their lack of parking space, in which was a problem for the entire food business in that area. However, you can always park your car over the Marriot Hotel and walk a bit, crossing the street and viola! You are here!

You can try to relax with friends/girlfriends. But it's a shame to go there because I just don't know what the menu and the place are. But it's a pretty cool place. And for the menu, because I happened to be there after eating, I just wanted to ice it so I didn't try the coffee. The snacks are pretty good too. It may be a confused choice to have coffee and spend time around there because there are many choices. Oh yes, the minus here is that there are a lot of buskers at night, so you have to be prepared for a lot of change.

Nice. On the edge of the rice fields, unfortunately the fields are not visible because it is night. The coffee is bali and there is gayo. The price is according to the pocket, it doesn't break. Various snacks and there are noodles. Saturday night and Sunday night it's crowded.

A decent place to cob for coffee and hang out looking for ideas to build a nation.

STMJ's shop is a regular when I was a student in Malang, the father is friendly and fun to talk to, the condition of the shop is neat and clean. The milk menu varies from hot to cold, and the concoctions are perfect and delicious. The price is very affordable for students, the place is nice and there are many food stalls around, so it can be used as a place to wait for food to be prepared while drinking milk here.

- Location: on the narrow street of Kerto
- Parking: park next to the shop
- Atmosphere: not too wide, but enough to chat with friends
- Food & Beverage Options:
> For food - there are Padang dishes with flavors that suit the Javanese tongue
> For Drinks - there are various choices of STMJ starting from the original to the taste
- Price: around 10 thousand for food and drinks

Good Food
Good drink
Good Price

From the outside it looks like an ordinary small cafe, but it turns out to be a very proper restaurant. The interior is super nice and well laid out, clean and tidy, the green tones are really pretty.

The service is very good, you don't have to wait too long for the food & drinks to come out. The ambiance is really nice and makes you feel at home for long. The music played is mostly jazz, perfect for casual conversation.

For food and drinks tend to be pricey. It looks okay, but the taste is really ordinary for that price. The hazelnut milkshake has lots of ice cubes, then the cream itself is half a glass. As far as I know, a milkshake should have milk and ice cream blended together, not hazelnut milk, add ice cubes and then add whipped cream to half a cup. The straws use paper straws, it's good to care for the environment but it makes it hard to drink the cream.

If the latte is okay, served with cookies and sugar separately. It feels great.

Cozy Hangout Place at Sukun

KADO Cafe offers a warm ambience, as well as friendly service. The place is quite spacious and there are also indoor and outdoor areas. Wifi is fast and there are plugs available, perfect for hanging out or working on assignments. I came here when it was just 2 months old. The menu offered is quite diverse, but not too much. It took quite a long time for the food to arrive, around 35 minutes, even though we were the only family dining in. Standard price 20k-50k. For the taste of the food it's not bad, Woku Chicken can be more absorbed in the seasoning, Cordon Bleu can have more portions. Sambal matah tastes fresh. Club Sandwich is on point. Overall there is still a lot that can be improved in terms of taste for KADO Eatery. Always success!

Food and drinks are good and quite a variety. Affordable prices
Good service, friendly, fast.
I think the place is easy to reach and find, comfortable, good atmosphere.

As a non coffee lover. The butter coffee is not bitter and tasted good. The fried noodle is decent. A bit too sweet for my preferences. Crowded and smoking area but overall good

Best kopitiam in malang town so far
I have tried some kind of places in malang, and i found that this place is the best overall
I like the butter coffee, not to sweet not to strong
I like the kaya butter toast too. It is a perfect combination.
I ordered the other food too, and all was good. The price is really affordable.
But, there is not enough chair and table. You have to queue for about 10-20 minutes. N.b i came at 10 am
Definitely will come back next time

oldschool kopitiam that everyone would love! it's located near train station, so we made a short visit to takeaway some food to be enjoyed in train. overall it tasted good with affordable price

If you like retro places, you must try this coffee shop. The vibes of this place is like 80s Singaporean coffee shops, who served Coffee, Milk Tea, Bread, and Half-boiled Egg. The coffees are great, their must try are the Butter Coffee and Coffee with Evaporated Milk. But if you like the classic, their Classic Black Coffee is a bomb. Also the Kaya Butter Bread! Sweetness from the Kaya jam and the saltiness of the butter mixed very well, it's delicious! Their menu is not too much, just a bit snacks like Cireng, Mendoan and Ngo Hiong (this one, very recommended!!), also the main course, like Fried Bakmee (a bit too sweet for me, but still delish!) and Soup Bakmee. Also the ambience, it's very cozy and calm, you'll want to spend hours here if you love the old city vibes.

Havana Banana is a culinary location that serves a menu of banana nuggets and banana crispy rolls as the main dish. Starting from the banana nugget business which is run through online ordering, now Havana Banana opens its outlet in the Baegopa outlet. Banana nuggets are popular processed bananas, bananas are reprocessed by crushing and seasoning them, then forming squares like nuggets. Meanwhile, Banana Crispy Roll is processed bananas that have been crushed wrapped in a skin like spring rolls with a slimmer size and fried dry until the texture is crunchy. What makes it special is that Havana Banana uses a type of plantain and a mixture of cinnamon powder in it. Plantains have a very sweet taste, fragrant aroma, and a softer texture compared to other types of bananas. The combination of plantains and cinnamon powder makes Havana Banana preparations have special characteristics and tastes. What's more, there are more than 11 suas and 25 topping variants that visitors can choose directly. Some of the most popular and favorite variants include Banana Nugget Mango, Banana Nugget Crayon Little Pony, Banana Nugget Choco, Banana Crispy Roll Crayon Little Pony, and Banana Crispy Roll Choco.

there is parking for motorbikes and cars. the place is big, nice, it's cold at night so it's better to prepare a jacket. can be rented for events too, can + live music too if I'm not mistaken. the place is a bit unique, the interior is eclectic, the lights are so cool, they keep coming through the shop in front of them. on some tables there are plugs, so sabi for nugas too. which in my opinion is less, maybe the main light can be added just 1 neon LED in the middle so it's not too dim

DISH
the food is delicious, the mentai sauce is real with tobiko, the blackpepper sauce is also very flavorful with the black pepper so it's not just sweet. The drink is also great, the chocolate ice is really nyoklat, not too sweet. But at night, the hot tea is the best, one pot and the black pepper rice bowl.

LIVE MUSIC
then certain days there is live music, it's really cool outdoor semi outdoor looking green while listening to music.

Put it in your go to cafe repertoir

It was a good place to kill the time with your mates. The place is quite easy to reach and also comfortable to chill or doing some work. The menu is interesting because you'll find different variant of coffee that rarely served at another coffee shop in malang like salted caramel coffee and also caramel macchiato which as far I know I can only find it at starbucks coffee. The minus is the lighting at night that just not the same the indoor and outdoor area, thats just look not so good. And also the concept of the indoor area was so so, I mean not really special. But over all the caramel macchiato was good :')

I tried their latte and it was real good. It was served in a cute cup, without a teaspoon (as other cafes would do). But I enjoyed it much. Also, their 'cireng bumbu rujak' is refreshing!

Good place with homey vibe and of course the Cappuccino is great for me with such price.

Nice little coffee shops, ample outdoor space, decent power outlets, good selection of beverage. The baristas were kind and polite (just make sure to ask them if there is any requests about your order, they'll be happy to help you or you just want to chit chat with them).

One of the new coffee shop in town. Probably will be my favorite now, since the place has very cozy ambiance to hangout and chilling with friends. The coffee is tasty, i tried the salty caramel one and i like it, didn't try the pizza and snacks next time will definitely try them!
Many Instagramable spots inside, I really love how they put many green trees inside and make it super beautiful and eco friendly. Fantastic! Most of the area are for smoking area, yet they also provide non-smoking room with air conditioner, from there I can feel comfy seat and good desk to work, wifi speed is acceptable.
They also have this facilities for customers, such as: large parking lots (paid), prayer room, clean toilets, faucet to wash hands (covid19 health protocol), and live music in the evening!
I really recommend the place to hangout with your friends and mingle with family here, however for digital nomad who wants to work (like me) or student who wants to do assignments here, maybe the place won't suit you because this is not coworking space as they claimed. Yet, if you want to do it here, i suggest you to do it in non-smoking room with AC.
Overall great coffee shop!!

Great! Delicious pizza, great coffee and convenient. Perfect if you want to meet up with your client or friend, even with family. Worth to try!

Good food, good drinks, reasonable price. The music played at the background are terrible (not the live music tho) They should compose their own music playlist, with such theme, such as 90s song, easy listening or slow rock, not just random singer/music on spotify.

Coffee is good, staffs are friendly, place is also ok, AC works fine, ambiance is nice with cozy chairs and sofa. Has two floors, I prefer upstairs because it usually more quiet and comfy. My favorite menu is the sandwiches and tacos!
Price is okay, taste is not bad at all.
The wifi here works fine, but not the best. If you meed super fast wifi, then this place is not reliable. Yet, its good place to go for coffee in the morning since they open very early at 7AM.
The only thing is that they don't have much parking side, it is located on the side of the main road so only can have one car parked and not many bikes too. Hope they will consider more parking lots.

The design interior is nice. The aircon is on and sufficient so it's quite cold and good inside. However, the coffee is so-so. I ordered Caramel Latte and Caramel Macchiato. The Macchiato one tasted quite strange since the milk was not that good.

Place is recommended for a meeting or work alone. Foods that served not the best but still ok even i have to say bit pricey..not meet with my expectations when i first see the price.

this place is perfect for solo experience. located beside a main road, you could have your coffee and snack while seeing vehicles passing by. price is totally affordable and they make their drinks wholeheartedly. thai tea is good. matcha even better.

My first time going to coffee shop in Malang, end up wanting to always be back. Its ambiance is cozy and artsy. The prices are reasonable with good quality foods and drinks (around Rp8,500 until Rp25,000-all menus except for pizza is Rp38,000). The portion of some foods can be shared.
Black tea is recommended to be ordered! Moreover for a person who can't drink coffee, like me.
The coffee shop provides a mini prayer room, or you can find masjid near it, and its located at MAN 2 Malang (it takes about 2-3 minutes by walking). Other facilities are available there, such as toilets which need to be kept clean, wifi, books, electrical socket and parking lot.

It is around farm field with great views and nice breeze of wind.
Live music on the weekend.
It is understandable if become hectic in prime hours.

I ordered sego sambel tongkol since they said it is the signature dish. It was too dry, both the rice and tongkol. The iced-coffee was too sweet. However, the ambiance is so-so but it doesn't match with its name 'Swara Alam'. I didn't hear any natural voices at all. Supposed to be they build a miniature fountain or pond inside so we could hear the sound of gurgling water.

Aight, im tryna be fair, most of complaints are about lack of service, especially food & snack service on prime time. So far I've never got unstatisfying treatment from the waiters (I hope it wouldn't be happened).

cukup bagus sejauh ini, mungkin perlu adanya peningkatan manajemen servis ketika prime time / full house.

Spacious outdoor cafe in the heart of Kepanjen City. Cozy and homey and it surrounded by a rice paddy field so it pleases you when you visiting here.

The ambience is not really great for work or study because it's pretty crowded but if you go here only for hanging out, it's quiet good. 7/10 for the americano. 7/10 for the sweet karaage. The place will crowded quickly as soon as it opened. Better reserved a table first before come here

+ Love the color palette of this cafe
+ The bar is so cute
+ Love the Wastafel area
+ Indoor and outdoor
+ Cute concept
- Limited parking lot
- Their food is not quite tasty
- Some furniture finishing is ugly

I came here when this coffe shop just open about a week, so during my visit this cafe always busy. I like their concept about recycling old house into new cafe, without break down the house.
Love their outdoor ceiling, because they use clear ceiling.

A coffee shop that has a unique concept in Malang is different from other coffee shops. It gets an 8/10 for ambiance because it's cute and unique. There are also quite a lot of seats provided, but the place is not too wide for a coffee shop because it is located in a residential area. It looks like this coffee shop is only suitable for chatting with friends and not for doing assignments because the place is quite noisy and crowded, so it's not comfortable if you need a place that's not noisy. For food and drink, I give a rating of 9/10 because it is delicious and unique, and the price is cheap. Various kinds of drinks and food are provided here. From snacks to heavy meals, and in my opinion, all the menus don't fail because they match their appearance with what is on the menu. Service 8.5/10 due to self-service drinks and food delivered by the waitress. Besides that, for those of you who like to take pictures here, a photobox is provided. for which, of course a separate fee is charged.

I do like this cafe! Small, but so comfort! I can say that I will be enjoy and no boring to spend a half day here! The food and drinks are so good!

Honestly their interior is a bit off. Their menus are okay but please, if you're in a small indoor place don't put your music volume too loud! Your customers will not get comfy and ended up not buying more of your menus!

the place is comfy. a good place for u, instagram-slave haha. pricey, at least for me. love the toilet. clean. the 2nd floor is to die for. they provide tables with sofas and live music on the 2nd floor. u can also see the night street through the balcony. the food is good. definitely a place for u to hang out

My personal favorite coffee shop in Malang.
The food and drinks I‚Äôve ordered always taste right on my buds.

I fell in love with the place thanks to the sofas area on the 2nd floor. They look a lot like a family restaurant in the west lol! It‚Äôs cute and private. The WiFi is fast and consistent, so you definitely can study, work, or just enjoy your netflix comfortably. I always visited the place in the morning till afternoon so far, and it‚Äôs never been too crowded. Perhaps because I haven‚Äôt stop by at its peak hour.

They accept ovo as well which is good.

It's a two-story cafe so the place is quite spacious. The theme for the 1st and 2nd floor is different, the 1st floor interior looks like a common yet comfy interior you'd find in any typical cafe. The 2nd floor looks like a family dinner place, the other section looks like casual-colorful themed, the terrace is woody-themed [?]

Their drink tastes alright and the pricing is no different than other caf√©s (around IDR 20K and up). We bought a toast and mozzarella stick, hmm... the taste and presentation can be improved.

There's a lot of seating arranged for small to large group. We went there around 8 PM and sat on the 2nd floor terrace. I tell you it's not the best place to enjoy the night. Although the cafe itself located in a strategic place with good parking space, the road is way too busy and noisy for you to hold a proper conversation without raising your voice.

Their salad portion is quite generous to share. Black ink squid pasta, korean chicken wings, fried rice, kecombrang rice with grilled prawns, even their Corn Fritters are good. They serve nice coffee also. Not the best, but I consider it's good.

I would totally skip their rice dishes and food altogether and just order their slightly better croissants. Their iced coffee used to taste good, but now its just a regular coffee shop that no longer has any ""i want that coffee"". I came here several times, and each time i was annoyed by their bad servers. May it be their senior servers or interns, they were all as bad.

There were people with laptops working and others enjoying tapas style foods, small plates, cocktails and coffee.  It was a bit warm, but really nice, with a buzz of conversations and people working.  We had cocktails and I would recommend them!  The service was fast and friendly.  And the balcony area was a great place for drinks and people watching.

Tapas(3 selections) shock us when it came to us. Typically a meal for both of us. Great coffee and smell good, and they sell coffee beans too(230K/pack).
My wife loves their juice.
Only downside is if you don't take onions garlic, there still taste of onion in our side salad, maybe due to the knife etc.
Overall, really a recommended cafe to visit for us vegetarians. High quality food, cafe price.

Nice place for vegetarians. Cocktails were buy one get one which is great, but mostly syrup and not much else. Great atmosphere, and lovely staff (they weren't sure what food was vegan). Food was bland and for a vegetarian restaurant very few vegan options (which is odd).

This cafe is a thing of beauty. From raw aesthetics to the food & service, everything goes just so well together.

When I came, they had a DJ show. I like that the music is not too overwhelming and could still be a good companion for a peaceful night out. The fish and chips is good!

The atmosphere here is really unique, different from the usual coffee shops with bright or monochrome color tones. Blackbarn is rather dimly-lit and full of tribal-style decorations like dreamcatcher and antler wall mount. The Shakshuka tasted and reminded me of lasagna except that it tasted eggy. On the other side, the Spaghetti Meatball turned out pretty filling. The tomato sauce was a bit too sweet while the beef meatballs were overly salty. Prices are practically reasonable given the central location (good news, there are no tax and service charge here).

A monochromatic coffee shop in central Surabaya. The price is quite high for a so-so taste of a drink. But it's got a cozy ambience. Quite a good place to hang out with your friends or relatives.

The place is so comfortable, very good vibes, old country was playing the whole time such as the name ""Barn"".

The drinks are good and the sushi is ok.
Lots of parking place for motorcycles but the cars have  to park on the side road next to it. Worth a try üòäüòä

Affordable good food with big portions, better sit outside under the shade because the indoor building is too hot even if all aircons were turned on. The service from the waiter/waitress was good, but not for the cashier. The cashier lady was unfriendly and not very welcoming towards me & my friends, she handled our order lazily like she didn't want to be there.

Love the ambiance. It's located in a quiet neighbourhood. Vast parking area. Very bright, the place will put you in a good mood once your glance at it. Really love the outdoor area. Best time to come here I think is around 3-5p.m. Coupled with Malang fresh air. Definitely a place for a fun gathering with friends. Food was alright. We ordered School Dosirak and Jjajangmyeon, with Itaewon (ReVe drink) and Hongdae (milk w/ salted caramel). Itaewon drink could be better. Hongdae was tasty. The staffs were very friendly and helpful.

Love the atmosphere here. For those who want to feel the Korean vibe and who like K-Pop, it's really suitable here. The parking lot is quite wide and next to Sejenak Coffee.
The interior design looks simple from the outside, as soon as you enter, you immediately feel the Korean vibes because of the Korean decorations and music being played. Aesthetic in every corner.
There are quite a lot of indoor and outdoor places. In the indoor area, there is a really good photobox. In the outdoor area there is a pojangmacha selling street food.
The menu options vary, from snacks to heavy meals. There is a grill package menu, ramyeon and other menus such as mandu, kimbab and many more. For drinks, there are quite a few choices. There is also a showcase filled with bottled and canned drinks. Prices range is 23 thousand - 55 thousand rupiahs. Suitable for lunch or dinner.

My favorite here is aglio o lio with extra mushrooms, the fried rice is also delicious, the coffee is great.  The atmosphere is good and friendly service.

Although this cafe is a standalone building and rather large in size, it can be easy to miss due to its awkward location around a bend of a road. It has wide open outdoor spaces which would make it a very pleasant experience if not for the fact that there are some roadworks going on right in front of it.

We had an iced coffee which wasnt bad, but the other order, which was the cold flowering tea was rather bland and tasteless. When i inquired what flowers are included in the flowering tea, the polite but a little uninformed staff answered me ""random flowers""

The windows provided a stunning view of the nearby stream, accompanied by the soothing sound of flowing water. It was the most unique cafe I have ever been to, and I was immediately taken aback by the tranquility and serenity of the surroundings.

The decoration is superb, it's like an oriental museum. Perfect for someone who loves antique or unique building and someone who loves taking photo. The water sound came from the river and the fish pond make a relaxing ambiance. But sadly, there is no smoking room in this cafe so the visitor can smoking everywhere and it's make me uncomfortable.

My two cents of this place would be the connection both menus and the ambiece, because the menus not-that-oriental antique, contradicts enough with the ambience.

Good vibes cafe with such a good books collection like Yuval Noah Harari's books. Not that pricey also. The menu's price ranged from around Rp. 10.000 - Rp. 30.000

Not a quite place that I would thought it be..my first time and maybe my last.

Nice comfy coffee shop at the center of Malang. The coffee and green tea we had was good. The price is very affordable. The wifi was good too, some people stayed to work from this place.

Kopi jaya was a good place to stay especially for chillin and having a good conversation while enjoying good quality beverages, but the thing that's makes me uncomfortable is the food is kinda taking too long to serve.

I MUST SAY THIS IS THE BEEEEEST COFFEE SHOP IN TOWN. Located in strategic area, the ambiance is very comfy, the store is not so big but they have the best coffee (Imo). The vehicles guy is so helpfulüíØüíØüíØ

Dua ruang is like, comes from nowhere in the middle of residence buildings, it is strange at first, but now i do understand what this place is meant to be.

If it is for work, finishing your assignment, and having your online meetings. This is the perfect place.

Well, it provides everything you need for a proper steady and quiet environment for a zoom meeting. The ambiance is not fancy but suprisingly comforting for online meetings purposes. Affordable standard menu range from basic cappucino to their signature drink.

It is very basic but yet only few places in town who offer this kind of services.

Good place for casual meet, Good food with good price but the the coffee that I ordered was not really good. A little bit long bitter taste eventhough the beans should be good

Good coffee good place

Had a nice time coming here 2 times. Menu is averaged pricing (between 20rb to 40rb), mainly serving coffee. Staff are nice and give a friendly vibe. Indoors also has a nice cold spacious room, with a 2nd floor to go to. Outdoors has 2 sides, 1 in the front and the other on the side (which I recommend more). Toilet is also clean and spacious, but keep in mind that there's no toilet paper (as of what I remember).

This is a strategically placed coffee shop on the side of main road and near some of the beautiful places in Malang. Unfortunately their coffee is not very tasty, I would describe their coffee as plain. They offer some tea and chocolate based product which I recommend more than their coffee.",0.8999999999999999,0.0253574943553522,0.5239037225728014,2256,"coffee, ruang, visiting, affordable, spacious, dua, menu, staff, signature, suprisingly"

They have everything you need as a decent cafe. I love that everything in here is super clean. The prayer's room and the toilets are super clean. The drinks are more on the expensive side but they are great. The indoor room can be rather loud but it's not that severe.

The service is way too good, friendly, love it! But maybe your music volume is too loud for the indoor plus the noise from the bar is quite disturbing especially for us who come here to work.

Fairly priced. Coffee starts from 15K. Snacks starts from 18K. The price on the menu are before tax, so there will be a slightly change when you want to pay.

Taste is average. I ordered Iced Americano and it tasted kinda watery, right after they served me.

Cozy place. It's the perfect place to have a me-time, good ambiance, not too noisy.

The place is nice with modern japanese vibe. There are various drink and rice bowl listed in their menu. I ordered matcha latte and it was good but it came in a small glasses. The donut is just ok, reasonable price (12K). The other pastry is affordable too, around 12K to 20K. My friend ordered the rice bowl and coffee, and they liked it. It's hard to find a coffee shop in Solo that is worth to visit often, and this is more likely one of them.

The ambience was really nice and cozy. Not too pricey and the interior is a plus one for me. Too bad the parking lot is a bit small. Another one that I like, there's a smoking room for smoker.

Second time enjoying coffee shop! Asagao brought japanese atmosphere to their coffeshop. In my visit, i order americano and french fries.

I think here is the most aesthetic place between all of the Janji Jiwa outlets. Toast is very worth the price! Coffee is good. Place is nice and clean. Free parking is what makes this place better. Highly recommended thing to spend time and money.

Texture is worse, almost crumbly. It's not how gelato should be. Lowered the star to 3.

2017 review:
Ice cream doesn‚Äôt have the real gelato texture which is smooth & silky.

I will skip the food if I go here.

Coffee is bad (mediocre Robusta)

Delicious ice cream, recommended, though the place is small, and the ice cream variety, most is mixture of 2, some are more than 2 flavor. I ordered the rumble crumble and its pretty good, its a mixture of kitkat and rum, also another recommend is the thatea, pistachio, and red wine chocolate (not sure if everyone gonna like the redwine one). Price wise is cheap to moderate.

One of a good gelato bar in east of Surabaya. Not just selling gelato, here you can order a well made and tasty meal such as bacon and egg spaghetti, katsu sandwich and many more with a wise price.

It is not a huge place, does not have plenty seatings, but such a nice modern dining/dessert place. They have free wifi, high chairs, toilets, parking and an outdoor seating area.

The white nuance, which is also obtained from the fence, some of the furniture, and the door and window frames, makes Bataputi Coffee House a clean and attractive photo backdrop. Coupled with a beautiful cafe environment, surrounded by trees and ornamental plants from the outside to the inside, Bataputi Coffee House has remained as a favorite cafe in Malang since its establishment in 2015.

Many potential photo backgrounds at Bataputi Coffee House. The most favorite is the outer part of the cafe, which has white rattan tables and chairs. We can take photos with 3 backgrounds at once: a wooden gazebo which is part of the smoking area, the Bango River and the trees on its banks that divide Araya Housing, and the magnificent Araya Bridge. Now the chandelier that adorns the Araya Bridge lights up brightly before night falls. Not only does it add to the coolness of your photo background, but it also makes the night atmosphere warm and romantic!

Just open every day at 3 pm, on weekends Bataputi Coffee House starts to get busy at 5 pm. Visitors generally aim to sit in the gazebo and non-smoking rooms that are air-conditioned and have sofas. Besides being a fun place, the food and drinks offered by Bataputi Coffee House are affordable. We tasted two coffee drinks recommended by the friendly cafe staff, namely avocado coffee and the other which is only available on weekends, es kopi susu tempo doeloe.

The coffee in avocado coffee is still quite dominant even though it is served with vanilla ice cream. So if you like light coffee, the creamy tempo doeloe iced coffee is more suitable. Moreover, the special thing is that this milk coffee ice is served with market snacks, the types of which depend on availability.

Heavy meals range from pizza, burgers, to rice, pasta and noodle based ones. Afternoon is the right time for snacking, so we ordered two snacks that cost around tens of thousands of rupiah: fried bananas, gula Jawa and onion rings. The onion rings are crunchy and delicious to eat warmly. However, you must order the Javanese sugar fried banana, which is not sprinkled with meises and cheese as usual, but in a traditional style with a sprinkling of brown sugar and young coconut.

Bataputi Coffee House
Jl. Araya Megah No. 9, Araya City, Malang
Open: Monday-Sunday 15.00-23.00 WIB

One of the best cafes in Malang to relax, unwind, and be close to the nature. It's really difficult finding a caf√© that has a good view and not just fake plants inside the building for pure decorative purpose. Bataputi has a wide selection of food & beverages, and in my experience, they all taste good.

Prices are reasonable, staffs are helpful. Wifi could be improved a little bit, especially in the outdoor area. But all in all, a perfect choice for a 'me time' or to hang out with friends and family.

To be honest I was a bit unsure to come to this place until last month. It was driven by the fact that lots of eatery and coffee house were open offering merely their good look.
Bataputi, however, indeed has good look especially for its interior and location by the river bank,and offers great food. I find the basic menu, such as fried rice, satisfactory. The fresh ingredients and combination of spices bring the savor everyone is looking for. Should one need to indulge in some comfort food accompanied by friendly coffee while enjoying afternoon breeze, Bataputi is the one to visit. The best time to be here is from 3-6 p.m.
The prices might be higher than average around Malang but it worth the money spending for.

The sauce topping is very delicious, I recommend the chicken cheese toast with a creamy mushroom sauce If you don't like sweet toast.

The choco & cheese toast is very sweet because the chocolate paste is very much. Be careful with your sensitive teeth üòÅ

The service is quick. There are plenty plug points if you want to charge your laptop. Their WiFi is steady at around 10 Mbps.

It deserves my five star. Would have been nicer if they turn on the aircond on the other side because it was quite hot and humid. Or a fan will do.

Nice spot for coffe break or just relaxing the night with friend or someone. Maybe you should have a friend for spend the time in this cafe. Nice.

Best coffee in Malang (in my opinion), and their burnt basque cheese cake, is the best I have ever tried.

The kombucha is on point! the chicken is good but the sauce is just average.

its my first time came here. I came here with friends and order a drink and the same food for each of us.. They have a very slow service, our drink was served after 30ish minutes and the food were arrive after one (1) hour. We already go back and forth asking them and they always say that its because the rice is not ready. and we are not the only table waiting in such a loooong time like that.

It is very sad tho, they could learn something about supply chain management and communication between team to prevent this kind of issue.

The service is good, the cashier and one of the waiters are friendly and answer all our questions despite the crankyness we had (hungry due to waiting for an hour).

Definitely a go-to place for cafe when you are in malang Huge portion of roasted chicken (which is tasty) & side dishes are delicious as well.

Cashier was also nice but I believe she could‚Äôve worked faster. If you‚Äôre muslim, there‚Äôs mushala so you won‚Äôt skip a prayer. Parking lot is super limited just so you know.

Honestly, i came here just because Alun-alun Batu were closed (ppkm thing i supposed) and couldn't get a parking lot. Not expecting anything special, but i was shocked because of the portion. Really not worth the money. Like i only have to pay more because the place is famous and has some good photo spots? Not to mention the fact that you need to pick your order by yourself. I mean, for that price they should give customers a better service.

Last Saturday night, my friend and I go for a walk around Batu town square. We feel thirsty and hungry. So, we were look for a place to eat. Because it's almost midnight, many cafe and restaurant are closed. However, we found one cafe still open. The cafe is named Susu Ketan Pak Yan. The cafe is located next to a gas station on Jalan Diponegoro Batu. The cafe is open 24 hours. Finally, we entered the cafe and ordered somethings. My friend ordered matcha ice and I ordered a hot cappuccino and milk sticky rice with cheese. The cappuccino tastes like any other cappuccino, not bad, I like it. The matcha ice taste is also delicious and the sticky milk is sweet with lots of cheese. The price of food and drinks served is quite cheap. The waiter is friendly. The place is also comfortable with a beautiful view on the 3rd floor, but unfortunately some of the tables that had been used were not cleaned immediately. I think it's because so many customers came. But in general, this cafe is recommended if you want to enjoy sticky rice with a beautiful view.

One of the nice and classic cafes which (as I know) has been operating for the last 5 years until now. What makes me come back around is their espresso-based coffee, that always consistent and tasteful. I do love their baked meals that are well paired with the coffee itself. And turnout their main dishes are also delicious and worth the price.

I ordered : Inns Combo & Chicken Katsu.
Plus: many food variety, homy & clean.

This place aren't serving up anything too different, but they're sticking to what they know‚Äîgreat roasted coffee.
It's a nice tiny place with a huge deal of details. Feel the unique vibe and enjoy the afternoon catching up with friends.

Another Malang's hidden gem! Recommend this place for coffee lovers. Not a big place, and the location is quite far from Malang downtown, but the design is really interesting, kinda industrial, but has a homey vibe. And since it has an open bar setting, you can have coffee talk with the barista, Mas Pandu, also the owner of this coffee shop. Lataroma means house yard, which is literally built in the owner's house yard. Yang jadi ciri khas di sini adalah semuanya serba manual, mulai dari mesin roastingnya, espresso, sampai untuk steam susunya. Untuk yang bukan pecinta kopi, bisa coba menu matcha latte atau caramel latte yang cukup manis. Range harga mulai dari 15 ribu sampai 35 ribuan. Overall, tempat ini yang menyenangkan untuk dikunjungi.

the city centre. The service is quick and friendly and they open at 9am. E-payment is available. Recommended!

They serve this delicious fusion udon (xilao udon) - a combination of creamy broth, udon, chicken with sweet soy sauce as the topping and you can add sambal matah. Another menu, ‚Äúroti sri rich‚Äù (srikaya) also have nice taste, it‚Äôs not too sweet

This place is located on the 2nd floor of Pasar Kranggan. Went there on CNY evening, the place was not crowded. The Roti Sri Rich and Coklat Butter were good. (I wish they offer original butter toast in the future because the toast bread was that good). Worth the price and highly recommended.

I know this place is famous on social media and highly recommend it. The place is simple because it is located on the 2nd floor of the Kranggan market, the concept of a shop with an authentic Chinese coffee shop in general but halal. The payment system here, pay first and then your order will be delivered, besides that for disabled access you have to climb stairs because the shop is located above. No wifi, toilet or prayer room available.
First time here, the menu offered is varied, but I only ordered the butter coffee which is the signature of this coffee shop. The coffee tastes like ginseng coffee with butter, I think it's delicious. For the second time, I ordered butter coffee, sri rich bread (jam sarikaya bread), Mie udon (udon noodles topped with chopped chicken and mushrooms), and chocolate ice. All the food is delicious, the Sri Rich bread is better when it's still warm, the chocolate ice is very delicious, most of the chocolate ice sold is mostly water than the chocolate, the udon noodles are delicious (the sauce is tasty, the chicken topping is delicious and uniquely uses sambal matah), I want to pay  expensive if the udon portion is upgraded haha. I like it, i will come often.

Kranggan market is really hype nowadays and this place is one of the hottest. Udon xilao (25k) has unique taste; chewy noodles with creamy broth, topped with (kinda of indonesian chicken noddles) many chicken meat and also (kinda of) sambal matah as a condiment.

As their name implies, the waffle is their best menu here, it's really good with a lot of choices for toppings. another menu i like are their cheese fried rice and platter (it's good but maybe they can reduce the onion rings and replace them with something else for more balanced variety). For their spaghetti, I recommend their bolognese spaghetti, didn't really like the other spaghetti especially their curry one because i think the taste just doesn't mix well. The atmosphere is quite nice, but I prefer the indoor space because there are lots of mosquitoes in the outdoor space. usually it's full with highschool students from nearby school so it can be quite noisy too

Be Cafe is one of the youth resto place at Surabaya. This place is near from surabaya‚Äôs best school such as smala and spensa. Various menu of drinks and beverages is served here so you can enjoy after-school with your colleagues or waiting for turtoring session. The prize of food at this place is high enough for student but fair for worker. Sadly this place is closed at 22.30 or not 24 hours service. You also need to prepare park retribution here. This place has outdoor and indoor so if you want to stay safe from smoker you can choose indoor one. The service at this place is fast enough so you dont need to wait so long to enjoy your foods. I recommend this place to students for enjoy their weekend after school and also for worker want to meet their friends if not until midnight.

Known for their waffle, they definitely don‚Äôt let you down. Their waffle tastes good and affordable.
The place itself is spacious with lots of tables. They lend board games and stuff for entertaining. They also have projector and screen which usually playing sport games.
The downsides are their staff isn‚Äôt that friendly. The floor sometimes are dirty. And from what I heard, the toilet is dirty as well.
Since I‚Äôve known the place (which recently) I‚Äôve been back like 5 times already. Exploring their other menu and back for the waffle.
Recommended for students and big group (teenagers).

Good place, lots of choices, they have snack main course, and dessert. we eat waffle and croisant. you can choose your favourite topping and ice cream. the price is inexpensive. they have outdoor area and indoor (with aircon). a good place to hang out, doing homework, or just eat.

Few years ago, if im not mistaken,
when i came to this place, it still named by 'be waffles', but yesterday, when i came there, it become 'Be Cafe', hehe

Nice place, aesthetic in all parts indoor & outdoor, for drink I like sigurih the most. When I went there, it was cloudy and then after a while it started to rain. While the indoor area is not that wide, so there are some visitors who take shelter outside, I suggest it would be even better if the indoor area was expanded.

Also, when I ordered a cheese cake, the cashier said it was available, so I paid for it, but after a while she said it was sold out. Finally I ordered another cake and the cashier said the change would be given to me later but she didn't give it to me until I finally asked for it myself as I was planning to leave.

So please improve the service again, and hopefully it will get even better on my next visit, but overall this is a great place üòÖüåø‚òï

Definitely one of a kind in Klaten. Healthy meals, fresh smoothies, toast and coffee are their specialities. Overall, portion of the meals are worthy for 20K-ish price. Try their signature coffee.

The place is so comfy, especially for doing some work or task with your laptop (WiFi is available here).

I ordered ice milk coffee called Pasti Kopi Susu and it turned out good.

Surprisingly at this nylempit place you can find  a cozy place to hang with your friends or just doing your stuff on laptop.

The coffee they serve is quite interesting. You can find es kopi susu with brown sugar here. Si refreshing!

Their accident coffee (maksudnya kopi tubruk) is quite strong. Its aroma is very good.

Lots of interesting drinks. Coffee, tea, or.. me? üòúüòú

But the camilans they serve is rather limited. Their cinnamon roll bun is quite nice. You can cokot it than use fork or spoon.

I like their interior design. Especially at evening. You can get beautiful selfie-selfie here.

Nice place.

And very helpful and friendly owner.

Well I think this place is pretty much great except for the fact that the air conditioner is not working. It was a rainy afternoon, I needed place for my homework and I remembered my friend told me about this place a long time ago. They have small room and limited table which is fine to me, but with limited air circulation I am getting sweaty and sweaty then I decided to leave. Fix the air conditioner and perhaps I‚Äôll go there again someday.

Even though its location takes more effort to reach from the main street, you'll be glad to discover some of their finest beverages... especially coffee. I personally choose their ""Pasti Kopi Susu"" as it suits my taste so well, it has a gentle flavor which is hard to describe here, so just find out yourself. The atmosphere of this place is great, many good spot to take beauty shot or a perfect selfie for your social media needs. I love their fast wifi connection and calm indie music playing in the background. Both barista are also cheerful and definitely the person you'll be willing to tell your story with.

Suka banget sama tata ruangnya, desain eksteriornya yg natural banget bikin pikiran bener2 fresh. Betah buat lama2 disini. Klo menu makanan minuman sih standar saja, ga ada yg istimewa tapi klo aku pribadi klo spot ini tuh memang lebih menjual ke sisi suasana tempat yg outdoor and natural.

Its exterior design is so natural, esthetic, clean, and so refreshing. So many water valves if you wanna wash your hands whenever you want. The parking is so large and spacy and FREE. I love the outdoor spots. The plants, the flowers are well-chosen and well-designed of course. The tables are made of wood but with special shape, called ""Lesung"", a big trunk which has a cavity that used to be used to pound paddy or rice in the oldtime by Javanese as a manual technic to grind the paddy into rice. The lamp stands are made of wood called ""Bajak/Luku"", a tool for plowing the field. The indoor spot has chairs and tables in ancient models. What kind of heritage in a hang out spot, loved it.

The foods and beverages are just ordinary like nothing special, but it is okay.

Overall, this place sells the spot and offers you a refreshing, heritage, and unforgettable moment.

First time coming here and I wasn‚Äôt impressed with what they offered on paper. Or perhaps because I‚Äôve spent considerable amount of emotional cost just to find the location. It was barely visible from the busy street on that Saturday night. However, it only took one bite to calibrate my frustrated mind cause the food was fantastic. My brother and I tried three dishes and my entire mouth was gladly participating. Chicken was tender. Beef was tender and super moist. Seasoning was on point. I don‚Äôt know about the rest of the menu tho. I‚Äôll come back later.

I have no complaint for anything about the food. It taste good, fair portion for the price. Waiters are all giving their best service. I just not really enjoy the ambience. I don't get the concept. It's too formal to be a cafe, but it's too loud and casual to be a fine dining place. I hope they could work this out, because i love their Nasi Seafood Siram Woku and looking forward to have another dine in.

Good food, big portion, and clean place. Although the price is expensive, the taste and the portion are worthed. The service is very welcome. I can say ""it is one of the best restaurant in Malang"".

Good food, even I can say the price is so cheap for delicious and  cool plating ..

The food is okay (although it was served not quite warm) but the service is very bad. First, you have to wait a long time for your food. Secondly, I don't understand why tourists have to pay in advance when Indonesians can pay just like in any decent restaurant, after eating a meal, just before leaving.
I don't really know what the reason is, is it racism against white people?
If you are trying to copy European/American standards then improve your customer service because unfortunately you don't have much chance to attract more customers with this behavior.
It's a pity because you could have found yourself in a large guide about Indonesia and now you will become viral on TikTok.

Located nicely in the middle of the city, i like the ice merak coffee one. Nice outside area,there‚Äôs plugs, and also wifi.
Only there‚Äôs no food yet, and sometimes the croissants sold out.

A good place to chill with friends, it has a nice ambience and comfortable place. I come here often because their coffees are so good, especially their kopi susu coconut. They serves snacks too, and its also tastes good.

Beautiful place, with very friendly and helpful staff on duty. For foreigners do spray mosquito repellant first as this place decorated with potted plants and trees, expect to donate a few ounces of your blood.

Price is considered normal for a cafe, give them a try if you are looking for a place to relax and gather photo content.

If you are a coffee addict, I suggest that you order a hand brew, about 4 beans profile for you to choose from. My feedback is that they consider upgrading their espresso machine and grinder for better shots and milk frothing. Not a fair comment maybe cause I have high expectations over espresso base coffee.

Service was excellent, very friendly staffs. Restroom was okay, but can be improved. Inside there was a vape store as well, but in a glass-separated room.

I was most impressed by their Furikake Karaage. To me, it tastes perfect--since I prefer sweet dish. I think it was worth the money. Meanwhile, their cafe latte is okay. Though I prefer another coffee shop's latte, Labore's is just fine. Lastly, I kinda like the vibe here with all black walls and furniture and it was not too crowded when I first visited the place.

couple month ago my frend tell me about coffe he bring from this shop and say ""the taste is nice and intruguing"" ..so today i visited this shop.. and ""yes"" it was..and ""more""..
this.. i think is proper benchmarks about coffe shop, not just coffe and place for hang around,  this place give proper combination about mood, vintage place, vintage coffe, proper serving attitude,  proper  knowledge, proper chat until hit your levels of coffe geeky-ness.
i stand to say this ""don't let your mind limited your curiosity just because intimidating aura of atmosphere"", the serving attitude in this place just sublime, is proper and nice to everyone..today i came with parfume ""reek de sweat"" and they just serving me with nice, good, kind of servings

Met with friends there. Ordered a pasta.
The black pepper was very strong, but its okay to my taste. The place was very homey. You had to make a reservation since the tables were limited.

The place is smaller than I thought, tho the decor is pretty nice. There's not that many choices of foods on the menu. Ordered some teas, panna cotta and other snacks. The lychee tea is standard, while the matcha latte is too sweet. The panna cotta is actually quite good. I appreciate them using natural ingredients for the foods. They seem to have some events for kids, there was a Halloween face paint event for kids when I came in.

Went here with my friend for brunch, it such a cozy and lovely place to visit! It was packed but the ambience was very nice and all staffs were helpful. The food was yummy, it really suits my taste. Love the opor baked rice, furikake fries, and garlic parmesan chicken wings. Definitely will revisit this place.

cheapest yet the most creamy coffee that i ever tasted.

One of the coffeeshops in Malang. The location is very strategic, close to campus. located on Jalan Raya Manunggal Sudimoro Malang City.

This place comes with an interesting concept. The place is also very spacious. Inside and to the side there are also flowers. The place is fun and very comfortable. There are indoor and outdoor areas which are both spacious and comfortable. Also there is an area above the 2nd floor which is very spacious.

The menu at this Coffeeshop varies both coffee and non-coffee and the prices are pocket-friendly. Good service. So for that, friends who want to drink coffee or hang out with friends. This place can be an option if you are in Malang.

I like the coffee, chill if I'm not mistaken (9/10)
Cookies (9/10) because it's fat and has chocolate filling in it
Churros with Tiramisu Sauce (9/10)
And my friend's cold drink I don't know how it tastes because I can't drink cold anymore
Instagrammable, friends
You can park the car in front of it or go a little further on the right side of the road, under a tree if you want it's better

They offered not only coffee, but the non coffee edition, such as milk. For the drink, they have only one size drink on coffee and non coffee (milk) edition. I ordered the classic one, ice kopi susu Diskuupi and I think the coffee is too weak, too watery, I don't know if it's supposed to be like that or it's because of the ice melted. Maybe next time I'll order with less ice. But I really like the size of the coffee, because it's slightly a little bit more small than regular glass of coffee in the other cafe, so they can still offer a cheap glass of coffee and get a compatible profit.
For the snack, they offer fried tofu and french fries with 3 variant of powdered spices such as barbeque, cheese and spice. The snack is offered by 2 size, small and medium. I ordered the small french fries with barbeque spices. The size is quite big for the small french fries and it tastes very good.
Oh and the other snack is the sweet martabak, I don't ordered it so sadly I can't review it.
Oh and the last thing, I found a review that said they offered a dimsum, I want to order it but I don't find it today. Maybe they don't sell it anymore?
2. Price (5/5)
The price is quite cheap, with 16.000 rupiah for the kopi susu Diskuupi and I think they offer 1 menu which is just coffee with a little less than 16.000 rupiah. For the maximum price I think it's not more than 30.000 rupiah.
For the french fries it's is super duper worth it! I got the small french fries for 15.000 rupiah only and my tummy is full ü§£

The place is comfortable and cozy, they have indoor and outdoor table, can come in if you are alone or with a bunch of people. They offered 2 WiFi. The speed and the quality of the WiFi is good. They also have sink and toilet that you can use. I really like the ambience and the music in here!
Overall I'll recommend you to come in this place and I definitely will come back (but I will try another drink ü§£)

A very nice place to grab a coffee or tea. They use haveltea which tasted good, you can get a 1x refill. Some spot outdoor might get less shade during afternoon. The price range is around what you'd normally find in cafes in Surabaya. The parking space can be limited for car. Food was good too.

It looks crowded but actually it's because other shoppers are selfish hanging out for hours just buying a glass of tea.

Simple. The price is enough to make you full without breaking your wallet, with the right taste. In my opinion, the chili sauce is not enough spicy kick for me who likes jarring spicy. But this can actually be made for people who want to eat it but not too spicy, because my friend wants to eat this, which unfortunately has a lot of the spiciness, he can't stand it and eats it so it's not enjoyable for him and people who can't handle spicy. So, for those who don't feel spicy enough, there's a whole chili just crushed in the mouth, it's as light as a firecracker for me. üòÇ

What a nice quiet space. I came in the afternoon and it was quiet. Nice to chill & enjoy some drinks / just read a book.
I didn't get to try the coffee because I've had too much for the day. Instead I had the peanut deconstructed pie. It was ok. I see in other people's review that there were different kinds of dessert which wasn't available when I was there. I assume they rotate their dessert menu.
It's a win for the space for me, will definitely go back to try the coffee.

One of the best coffeeshops I have ever been to. Always recommended to my friend

Although the price is quite expensive. The coffee is always on the right taste and also has an ice cream menu now. Two of my favorite drinks combine into one place.

The vibe is also nice to those who like quieter place to work or study. Even Though the chair is a bit small.

Also have a smoking area separate from non-smoking areas.

Recommendation drink: Hazelnut latte and latte float

Small place but good vibes, 24/7 operation, a little pricy, easy to access the coffeshop, dirty toilet. Smoking area at 2nd floor.

Four stars for the coziness and calmness of the place, very suitable for working or studying. The manual brew coffee is good, they also have many variants of beans. The drinks are pricey for Jogja standard, we spent 33k for the coffee and 33k for the sweet corn tea.",0.825,0.1067562091124877,0.5161551699183696,2432,"coffee, cozy, recommendation, menu, area, definitely, coziness, enjoy, 33k, deconstructed"

USED to be a cafe. Now they turn the business to coffee roaster and supplies. Several cafe around Greater Surabaya and some from Central and West Java have joined the network.

One of its promising product is marketed under MawlieCoffee label. The coffee beans came from distinctive coffee plantation all over Indonesia.

Great place with great ambiance. Located in a road full of cafe. But i think the decoration of this one is really the best among others. Ordered the green tea latte and it taste delicious. Really cheap too only for 21k.

We‚Äôre here cause we haven‚Äôt lunch and we wanted to catch up about work (meeting). One of my friend asking the Barista nicely to lower the music volume, at first he say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do that blablabla‚Äù but when we start to talk, he begin to push his cellphone button so that the song / music didn‚Äôt ruin our conversation. Thanks Mas baik!

The ambiance is something (to my architectural eyes,, hehe) love that organic meets industrialists decoration. The ceiling that combine the organic element with some of industrial yet organic lamp, also the table and chairs that fits perfectly with the entire decoration. Lit bit Bali - feels like cafe.

The minus here : there‚Äôs many ‚Äúsold out‚Äù dishes eventho I thought its not prepared at all, they just write down the dishes but they didn‚Äôt really cooked it . And the toilet is dirty, smelly. Not comfortable to use. Period! The fact that many of the beverages / refreshment they serve in a plastic bottle with glass of ice on the side. not really environmentally friendly. I m just lucky that my piccolo‚Äôs serve with espresso glass and they even make some art on it.

Their piccolo is somehow nicely present, and taste good 7.5/10. The katsu curry rice surprisingly taste nice eventho the katsu not perfectly cooked (the chicken‚Äôs too dry and we can easily separated the chicken meat with the (flour skin/ batter) they didn‚Äôt stick together LOL. But the curry taste just fine and the plate were so cute and small so I guess that this menu is perfect for the people that wanted to deficit their calories :) 

We can pay with debit card with minimum order 10k ( 2 bottles of mineral water), they not support Qris yet, I dunno why. But we can definitely pay with cash money or debit card.

The parking man is super nice to all of us, and also so kind.

Beautiful place to enjoy a sip of coffee with your friend. While chit chat, you can enjoy their cake slice or maincourse selection. Any spot is instagrammable. You must try

Ordered the Salted Caramel Latte which came in a 250ml plastic bottle by default. It was lacking in saltiness and the caffeine kick was not quite there.

As a new plants lover, seeing the inside look of the restaurant is pleasing to the eye. I def love every and each part of it. The foods taste decent, not outstanding but definitely more than average. The price is relatively cheap (20-25K Rupiah per person). The service is good, the vibes are cool and homey. Its location is quite far from the city's center, but it's worth a visit ngl.

Kopi susu and kopi vietnam has good taste. The atmosphere of this cafe is really nice. Be ready for insects here. All staff is kind. Parking area is about 5 cars only.

It's very fresh because there are many plants and flower, it's like a garden coffe and it's instagrammable place for you.. its located in the Malang regency, surrounded by the paddy fields.
The price of the menu is achievable, you can choose this place for your dinner in the noon or in the afternoon.
But, when you order rice pack you must wait for a while because the waitress is only one so you have to be patient..
Get this place with google map direction and you can get this easily.

For contemporary coffee lovers, this coffee is suitable. The coffee is soft, delicious in the stomach, not too strong. The service is fast.

For a cheap price, let alone use shopeepay

For good coffee. The service is also really good, the place is nice to relax too. But for music, please turn it down, because for a coffee shop, the music is too big and the songs are not relevant, it's not a good place to chat with friends.

It's really great that this is 6k Jazz coffee and 7k Gresik milk coffee at Cafe Jazz

This place is the champion after all! They consistently provide good coffee (especially the single origin selection), they also have one card for each and every coffee you order to explain the detailed information about what's on your cup. They have non-coffee beverages too, and wide selection of foods. You want snacks, lunch, dessert, traditional, western, they have it all. Please note that they have very very wonderfully affordable price. They have indoor smoking area, anyway. I know some of you might need it :)

One of great coffee shop in town. They have good taste of coffee. They also serve many varians of food and drink, coffee and non coffee are just as good.
The barista is friendly and pleasing.
They have two floors, large room, many books. But parking area is not really  spacious and I suggest to taking care more to the cleanness of toilet.

I went there around 10pm and it was so crowded
Tbh it was so cold, so if you can't bear the coldness, prepare your jacket, since it's Malang's night.

It was so crowded and it was Saturday, that we wait the drink for 40 minutes.

The seats are right in front of visitors, so you can immediately see the coffee brewing process and talk directly with the barista.

Tasty cheap coffee, the single origin is really good, the owner is kind, I've been given Gayo's free coffee milk, it's really good, now it's a more comfortable place to hang out üòÑüëçüèºüëçüèº",0.8999999999999999,0.0042841428819544,0.5148421814392403,2508,"cafes, mayan, americano, brewing, prices, tasty, susu, populist, malang, talk"

+ my favorite dessert bar in Town!
- small place
- toilet is too small
- limited parking spot
- no big signage in front, so you need to look carefully

Best bingsoo i‚Äôve ever tasted! My favorite one will always be their strawberry cheesecake bingsoo. Cost around 40k rupiah to get this bowl of sweetness which can be eaten by 1-2 person. Make sure to pick the right time to come here, because usually they‚Äôre full and there‚Äôs a waiting list (especially on the weekend).

Super ecstatic to have an authentic bingsoo place in Malang. I mean the bingsoo that usually being sold in my hometown usually the cheap version. But Timtong elevated it close to the actual bingsoo supposed to be.

It was delicious, the ice shaved is so soft and creamy because it was made from creamy milk and processed using the real bingsoo machine. The red bean on my Azuki Matcha is also royal. I mean they gave me lots of it so it is guaranteed you‚Äôre gonna be satisfied to have one bowl of shared bingsoo here.

The single serving is actually for 2 portion and the sharing serving can be enjoyed by 3-4 person. The price is affordable. Place is comfy but too small and often had long queue. The sweetener is using honey. Anyway they also sell refreshing drinks and tea which are also hard to miss.

I will definitely go back here and recommend this place despite its well-known association with the Masterchef winner üëÄ

a quiet place to enjoy coffee during the day even though it's in the middle of the city (if there aren't many visitors of course hehehe) cool place and seats make you feel at home for a long time
the price is also friendly

In my personal opinion, the place is very comfortable, the atmosphere is calm, and it's also not noisy from vehicles, because the place that goes into a small road is even more comfortable.

It's perfect for quality time.

For the price, it's so so, it's not much different from the others, in terms of taste, it's okay. There is a choice of non-coffee coffee for drinks and snacks and heavy food, only noodles, right.

Really recommended if in my opinion those who are looking for a place for quality time.

Not too noisy even though it's in the city, really comfortable for those who need their own space. The vibe is beautiful because there are lots of plants around it

The place is small but comfortable. The food and drinks are cheap and delicious. The venue is one with KopiTangku.

Nice vibes

Found this warkop by accident when passing through Cor Jesu. It turns out to be a humble and nice place to chat. There are several types of drinks and the prices are still affordable. Plus on weekends you can have morning coffee here, interesting!

If by chance it's late and you are looking for a place to drink coffee or tea, you can come here, especially after the rain it is suitable to cover and drink warm drinks here.

For the drinks themselves, there is coffee, and quite a wide selection of teas. I personally think the selection of teas is quite unique and worth trying all of them. I tried the milk tea myself and it's quite suitable for the taste, maybe next time I'll ask for the level of sweetness to be reduced. Then had time to try the lemon grass eggplant. Unique, warm, and fresh, that's the description. Perfect for accompanying the evenings after the rain.

For food there are some snacks that can accompany your cup of coffee or tea, please check what's available.

As for the seats themselves on the side of the road around this warkop area, there are quite a lot of chairs, so don't worry about not getting a place. Likewise, the parking area is also wide and guarded by parking officers, safe.

The coffeeshop itself is only a building for the bar area. And in my opinion, the arrangement is really neat, starting from the decoration with retro items, then the arrangement of the tea jars and tools is neat, it's nice to see. It also makes you feel at home looking at the bar and then seeing the crowd around. Accompanied by the sound of the street. The point is serene.

Overall a fun place, always happy to stop by a place like this. Immediately put it on the list of warkop that are worth going to!

For a place it's really good to hang out, free parking. Prices are almost the same as other cafes.
For TWG's original menu, there are a few variations, unfortunately heavy food such as noodles, penyetan etc. are not originally made by TWG, because I was suspicious of the plate, after asking the employee, yes, it was true that it was from the stall across the street. Even if you take it from the opposite stall, the packaging is made at cafe level, not like eating at a food stall.

The place is interesting for those who don't really like crowds, the snack menu is less varied.

Even though it's not that wide
But the place is fun and romantic
Cold and hot drinks and snacks are available
No heavy food

The feel of the place is a bit luxurious in my opinion..

Nice taste

STMJ is the center of the city when you want to wander around at night, serving food besides STMJ and Ronde. There is fried duck with jumbo size which is not the best but it can be an alternative if you eat duck at night while drinking stmj, the inside area might be a little dirty, my advice is to eat on the sidewalk area.

It's special here if you want to drink wedang an, the STMJ has a patent.. Syegeerr rek.

The snacks also have various satay.

I ordered their Pot Ayam Kungpao and the amount of chicken dices surprised me. It was a lot. And it tastes great actually. Yet, the star was the butter coffee. It was my first time drinking such a unique and calming coffee. They added some butter into the coffee and when they're blended, it gave some sweet creamy kinda taste. I love it!

Beware of the queue as it gets so long on weekend. Pricewise is cheap as the portion is big. The main dish served at 09.00 but it opens at 07.00 so if you come before 09.00 you have to wait for the dish to be served. Really love the rice pot because i think it only sold here. The kungpao is dominant with sweet taste but really great. I recommend you all to order the milo tarik cause its super great üëçüèª

nice ambicence, like singaporean kopitiam in 80's

Good coffee and teh tarik

Must try the claypot rice, savory and tasty
and kaya toast, the sweetness is just right.

Beware of the crowds every weekend morning.

I don‚Äôt usually give 3 stars rating but i hope this served as a feedback to improve. Was honestly liking the whole ambience of old chinatown neighborhood because it just felt so nice & very down to earth. What gives me not so pleasant is it took too long to serve when there‚Äôs no queue. Ordered butter coffee & somehow it‚Äôs fine just not really my liking. Also ordered kungpao chicken which tastes okay (which for me i think you could do better to make it taste more like kungpao chicken), and the last is mie kwa which I don‚Äôt really fond of‚Ä¶. It just tastes wrong. The noodles are okay, it‚Äôs ordinary but the soup is just ??? I‚Äôm losing the concept of the taste because it‚Äôs herb-y, with the wrong kind of bitter taste in it. I hope you could improve the taste somehow and take this feedback because the place has a good potential !

The ambience is like ""tempo doeloe""

For fun, I asked the barista who happened to be the owner himself ((((((: he said, this coffee is originally from Aceh. So for coffee lovers, you should know how different it is.

I came here at night but wanted to try here in the morning. The problem is that there is bird's nest rolled which my friend said is also good for catching huhu

Ambience is okay, it's quite comfortable because there are chairs that use the famous GT chairs, soft on the buttocks. I think it's important for those who want to be here for a long time to hang out or something.

Regarding the price, it is cheap for the Kopitiam class, let alone Aceh. It seems like this is a new Aceh Kopitiam shop in Malang. Yagasih?

Will come back again. But morning.

I was interested to visit this place for I saw plenty parking customers' motorcycles by the fence every time I pass it. Unfortunately what I got on visit was opposite to inviting.

Arriving at this place, this place was pretty empty. It was around 2 in the afternoon. The room design was simple....it is more like dull square chairs and rectangular brown tables. Definitely nothing about its atmosphere attracts people to come. The street at its front was noisy and it is a huge oven with metal roof, ready to bake anyone. Probably it is so since there is no tree around it.

The coffee was actually fine yet it does nothing to reduce the inconveniences. The perfect disaster brought by its french fries. It was served on a plate of 20 cm of diameter and looked slightly wet. When I touched it was really damp, seemed like soaked in cooking oil rather fried. And thanks to the fries bland taste, my disappointment was complete.

I still do not understand the reason people coming back to this place.

Refreshing real strawberry milk amidst a storm of high-sugar flavors. Love it

Great scenery, that‚Äôs all there is to it. Food‚Äôs way too expensive for their mediocre taste. Awful sanitary as there‚Äôs only 1 available toilet in such vast area, which is also dirty and almost no water running (you guess it, long queue only to take a pee).

Don‚Äôt even get me started with a whopping 10k rupiahs parking fee. It‚Äôs ridiculous while you got to go through unpaved one-way road to get there. The lot‚Äôs also all muddy and slippery, so you‚Äôd better watch your step.

Noi Coffee is the newest hangout spot with mountain nuances located in Cangar, Batu City. For those of you who are looking for a contemporary hangout with natural nuances and lots of photo spots, try visiting Noi Cafe Cangar. guaranteed you will be immediately amazed by the views that are on offer. besides the price of the food and drink menu which is very affordable, the taste is also delicious so it is perfect for those of you who want a thin relaxing vacation.
This cafe itself just started operating in September 2020 and immediately went viral on social media, of course you can already guess why this cafe is quickly becoming famous because in this place the view feels like above the clouds combined with the contemporary cafe design. The atmosphere in this place is very comfortable and away from the hustle and bustle of the city and the weather is cold enough typical of the mountains so that enjoying a cup of hot coffee will feel even more delicious.

Pros:
- nice place to enjoy coffee with mountain views
- nice atmosphere, they have plenty of beautiful plants and flowers.
- relatively cheap compared to what we get.

Cons:
- car park is organized by locals, and they cost us 5 times more than normal parking cost in malang area. That, and we don't get adequate parking spot. NOI management stated that they're building their own parking space, hopefully they'll finish it soon.
- they play old 90s disco at their place. Not the best playlist for cozy coffee place.
- plenty of flies. This is natural and seasonal and the Management can't do anything about it. Choose indoor area if you wanna avoid flies.

I got there late and it was cold. So i ordered kopi Tubruk Arabica and soto ayam. It was a great choice.",0.825,0.1006194639032015,0.5135163694783766,2653,"cafe, visit, noi, mountains, mist, fee, mediocre, cashier, cons, hopefully"

The first impression begins with the conversation from the host, who happens to be the processor, who explains smoothly and never gets tired of inviting his visitors to visualize a little how coffee from Kawi is processed and served with a quite unique taste!

Apart from serving good coffee according to personal opinion, the hospitality and serenity at this place have become one of the ""escape"" and ""hidden gems"" among shops in Rajekwesi, Wilis, Malang City.

Come here every morning at 7 on Sunday-Tuesday for ""NgoPag"" and have a light discussion about the coffee served

With the experience and taste tours gained, Coffeenensis is counted as one of the pocket-friendly Coffee Shops, of course in accordance with Malang City which is filled with students and their walletsüòÑ

People really like to chat and share about whatever they can, so it's also suitable to ask them questions about coffee while looking for new experiences.

Hopefully it can be crowded as well as other cafes in the center of Kayutangan Heritage.

a coffee shop that just opened around mid-2020 last year, has its own customers. Carrying the concept of minimalism and sitting on the floor, the simple design gives its customers a comfortable feel. An easy-to-find location and sufficient parking area, only for a few 2-wheeled vehicles, but quite busy for a shop that has just opened. Various warkop special drink menus, such as black coffee, tea and instant coffee sachets, as well as food dishes such as fried rice, fresh vegetables are also available (several conditions), there is also a menu of various flavors of sticky rice. The price offered is relatively economical.

Sara takes advantage from the building original colonial architecture to present warm atmosphere for customers. With calm yellow light and some colorful wall and garden decoration, customers are welcomed to have some humble-but-classy dining.
They serve familiar snacks, such fried banana and fries, decent and well cooked. Some meals like fried rices are also available for those hungry tummy to fill before a long chit chat over coffee. The coffee prices are reasonable and brewed perfectly balance. What I do like from their coffee is that they present it separated from the sugar, so I never miss the original taste.
Sara is a family and small group friendly place to spend quality time at. And still, this place is suitable for customers of all ages.

But the garlic butter something was too much garlic.. make the taste weird

Many times order here from go food and grab food .. they never read the note!!!!!!!! I asked for well cook egg!!! And sometimes its comes without cutlery etc

They have a huge portion for a rice box. The garlic butter chicken boxy is plain for me and the garlic is too much on the chicken. The thai tea is also too many ices, so the flavor is plain. After all, they have nice packaging.

Only had drinks & snacks here, so have no idea of food taste.

Coming here because of the name. I thought this place serve traditional Malang cuisines,  unfortunately most of the main courses are western (pizza, steak, sandwich, etc).

Because we're hungry, we continue ordering with minimum expectation. The price are reasonable (most expensive menu is steak and its only IDR 100K).

Food verdict: food taste are excellent, we order almost everything. Pizza, submarine, spaghetti, grill dory, all of it great. Except for steak. It said Japan wagyu, but the meat is very tough, i've order it medium, it should be tender. So the most expensive menu is a big no no üòë

All and all, this place offer great food, but i think it should offer more indonesian menu, so its align with the name of the place.

Their food and latte is really good, even their price is lil bit expensive, i think its worth. Their food price range from 15k-115k and for beverages is from 10k-30k
For service is really good and fast service.
I love their concept for outdoor seating and enjoying the garden. Parking area is spacious too

Great place to hangout, the air is very clean and cool. There is also outdoor table,so you can enjoy the view from above. The food is pretty good, and they have many kind of beverages, also the price is around 20k - 50k. I definately recommend this place for you to visit

Very relaxing and cosy dining experience here at Omah Kitir. Food and beverages are tasted well. Pricing is cafe standard and quite moderate. Staff is hospitable. Free wifi is available here.

The foods and snacks are good. The seats and lights also good. I know this is a coffee shop, and most of the customers only looking for one drinks or one snacks, but I think they should consider to create meal+drink package for customers who do not drink coffee and looking for heavy meal here.

This was my first visit. I asked the cashier about the difference between latte and dolca, which one had less strong coffe. The cashier patiently answered my question and that was a great experience. When my order was ready, they called my name through the speaker. I am not an expert about coffee but their coffee was good and fulfill my expectation. I took an outdoor seat and it was fun and breezy. Overall, I had a great experience here.

The location is not beside the main road, so it's more quite. The place is good for people who wants to drink some coffee and stay or sit longer comfortably with friends.

If you don't like coffee, there are alternative drinks like chocolate milk, tea, etc.

There are two areas; inside with aircon, and outside for people who smokes cigarettes or just want some fresh air.

Good alternate for hangout with friends. Located in Pogung where most of the college student lives so you can easily find it, the pricing list is quite decent for a coffee.

I have to say that the food was quite expensive, lol. You will need to spend around 100k per person if you want to visit this place. However, they do have a nice atmosphere since it is located in Batu area.

You can see the city view and enjoy the breeze while enjoying your foods. I recommend visiting this place after sunset since the viwe will be prettier.

my first impression was: the menu is really variative, with affordable price range. the croissant is also really good, crispy yet buttery. definitely must try. i really like the iced coffee latte. i also ordered caesar salad, which surprisingly came in big portion. definitely will come back to try other menu!

I remembered that this bakery was succesfully made a good impression to me especially for their ciabatta bread, but i think recently their quality is not as good as before. Its still enjoyable but i have to say that they could be better..
If you have time, go dine in or takeaway is cheaper than order via grab/gojek since they will upcharge price up to 20%.

Price is almost the same as the other boba place. But the quality of their plastic cup is not good (pretty thin) cause i found it cracked several times. The taste is average but refreshing and i think this is the most popular boba place in the city.
Usually full of kids playing Jenga (so yes sometimes its noisy)

one of my favourite cafe in pekalongan, central java. and i think it is also a cozy place for studying. This place not only provides tasty food but also wifi and easy listening songs.

still one of my favourite coffee shop and cafe in town. the coffee are good and smells really nice. not to mention the original coffee, but I also think the other menu with coffee ingredients are still good. They do not put too much unrelated additional ingredients and maintain the real taste of coffee.

They serve some dishes and main course, some of them are really delicious while some are okay. Well, I don't usually go here to get the food, but the coffee and the place to hangout.

The place, here in Plaza Surabaya branch in particular is nice and have a good ambience. love it. the chair are really cozy, but somehow I feel the chair are to big compared to the table. but, it is okay anyway. they have WiFi, non smoking area, and some electrical socket.

The prices is practically quite costly, but they serve you with best quality of coffee, food, place, and services. so, it is fine.

overall, I would recommend this place for hanging out or if you want to grab some nice cup of coffees.

Their menu consists of Japanese comfort foods. The coffee was strong and quite decent. The staff is very knowledgeable and can explain the menu with great details. Overall I have a positive experience in this place and I really like it. Will visit again soon.

If you are looking for an authentic Japanese cuisines, I don't think this is the place. A relatively small cafe/ restaurant that has its own dedicated coffee bar and it is known for its delicious rice bowl. The ramen there is standard, it is not that delicious but it is not bad either. Overall, the place is clean, customer service is standard, it has a nice calming vibe, price is a bit expensive but it is still reasonable. Just a good place to chill and eat rice bowls after quarantine :)

Small cafe at san antonio shopping street, Pakuwon City, East Surabaya. Nice interior. But slow service and the staffs can be improved.

Recomended are crispy pork don, gyudon, gyutandon.

The food is good! The place is a bit small, but quite homey. Parking space is huge since fukudon is a part of the san antonio shopping street.

Minimalistic and modern themed restaurant and you won't think their main menu is rice bowl. Ordered Oyakodon and their signature iced coffee. The oyakodon tastes burnt and dry, literally wrong all over. My cousin ordered the wagyu don and it tastes very good, so I don't know why the oyakodon tasted like that.

Actually its gonna be a late review cause i've been here for like a month ago. Ok next, so from my opinion is Sudut Coffee is just like others coffee shop startup like a plain concrete chair, small rock in the floor, you know what it is. But it is not a bad thing nor a good things. For the coffee its the same thing but here they serve their signature jamaican something i kind a forget, and i belive its mixed with some rum, but correct me if im wrong. The last things is the cookies which is good, i like it. Overall its okay for me.

Good place and cozy, the baverages taste good but nothing special, the price is standard

We came here two times while staying in Malang! The menu is very diverse, lots to choose starting from western dishes finishing with some with indonesian twist! Fresh and healthy food. Portions are not too big so just order loads and try everything like we did! Probably the only vegan place in Malang, lovely atmosphere and amazing smiling staff! We also bought two packs of their homemade cookies to snack on the train! Defo recommend!

Food is good but the service time is terrible. I ordered pasta and green soup waiting 1 hour 12 minutes

Good decent gym with nice pool. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. Overall good experience

Ordered from Gofood the price doesn't reflect the taste and the food quality because i got a very delicious pasta and burritos for a very reasonable price. i went to an Italian restaurant in malang before they have an Italian chef so the price is kinda little bit more expensive but i could compare the taste tbh so definitely worthy although i hope they can improve the burritos a little bit because there's too much sauce and i prefer them to be fresh with less or no sauce.",0.875,0.01111561396399,0.5035297140045157,2915,"restaurant, gofood, vegan, fresh, train, malang, prepare, reasonable, bought, theres"

Nice and comfy place to relax

It seems that every time you go to Blora, you must stop by here, the right meeting point, spacious parking, lots of seats, the feel of an ancient Javanese kingdom. Betaj has been hanging out here for a long time. Prices are very friendly. Wedang and coffee are champions.

The most comfortable place to hang out, the beautiful atmosphere, far from the noise of motorbikes, the coffee is delicious, it's good, it's fresh, when it's just lifted, it's warm, the car park outside, the motorbike, parks in the middle, the garden is full, the atmosphere is full joglo, carving coffee, feels like at home, josss anyway

Omah Majapahit is one of the most recommended places to drink coffee and eat for those of you who live or visit Blora.

The classic feel that comes from the teak wood building and other ornaments really brings you back to the Majapahit era.

The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis place is probably about one hectare. If you visit you can take a seat in the place and angle that you want the most. You can sit on a teak chair, under a light bulb, on an iron chair or cross-legged. Everything will not reduce your comfort.

Besides that, you don't have to worry about the menu. Various menus are available here, ranging from coffee to various types. There are khotok, robusta and Vietnamese coffees as well as milk coffee. You can also order fruit juice or something. If you are hungry you can order food, chicken rice, egg sausage rice and so on. There are also snacks such as sausages, potatoes and others.

Oh yeah, don't worry, the prices are according to your pockets, starting from just 4 thousand.",0.875,0.0085682857639089,0.5024343628784809,2945,"javanese, coffees, visit, teak, blora, area, relax, menu, motorbikes, crosslegged"

The roof is made of tin, so it's quite hot where there are lots of students, but the service takes a long time, the value of the drinks is from 1 SMP 10, the problem is the taste of the coffee doesn't use boiling water.

Please make the service more friendly. There was a misunderstanding with the cashier about the order, but the cashier didn't explain it properly, instead he was stubborn. I appreciate that other staff can speak well but why is the cashier like that. I'm disappointed because I usually hang out here often. But because of this incident I became lazy.

Cozy place

Previously there was no intention to bring down any other place. But seriously, bro, I've been here many times when I pass by and want to warm it up. There's a conclusion I can draw: even though the place is old-fashioned like this, the quality is still legendary... In fact, this is more suitable than the one across from the one in Glintung... The taste of the milk is fresh and super delicious, the free-range chicken eggs are also of very good quality....

Sauce for the chicken chop is good but oily. Pricing is standard. Good packaging for take away and delivery. Food can be ordered by food delivery app

Ambience and the staffs were okay but after waiting for like 40 mins (which is  long if you ask me) the foods and drinks that came together were all served cold. Not the best option considering the pricing is pretty standard for similar cafes yet my drink tasted nothing like what i ordered. Came here to work on my laptop but the wifi is down and even if they'd work, staffs said the wifi got a time limit for 3 hours. Like??
This was like my 4th time here and before this my experiences were ok if not the best but this would be my last. Won't be coming back again.

Took a long time for the food to come out, no table service so we have to wait for the food downstairs. Ordered some cupped drinks and one of it wasn't sealed properly so it spilled everywhere when carried.
Someone else also took my order without the cashier noticed. Maybe they should have put numbers/names in an order so it's easy to call out the order and no one will mistakenly take other people's order.
The place itself is nice but it's crowded, and sometimes there's a selfish customer that takes table for 4 by themselves.
The menu wasn't updated, I came here for Tacos as they have it on the menu on Google Maps but when I came here, they don't have it. For Malang standard, it's quite overpriced.

wait for approximately 30 minutes and the server ended up saying the food that i ordered was out of stock. coffee milk??? should've named it MILK coffee, barely tasted any coffee.

Really nice place to get relax here, good foods taste, friendly prices for me..try it, you won't regret it

the place is decent, the employees are many, the food is also not bad, the drinks that I ordered are also okay

there was a message
fried noodles, boiled noodles, rainbow toast, cheese toast, roasted corn, taro pure milk ice, chocolate milkshake, ginger wedang, chocolate ice, warm orange

I think the taro milk doesn't taste like the milk, but it takes a long time to taste the taro, that's it, the chocolate milkshake is okay, then the rainbow toast color is like that ü§£ at first, you can see it on tiktok, the color is really pretty, but it's worth it the price is good, but for those who like a lot of stuffing, it's perfect, if you like standard, it'll be bad because there's a lot of stuffing, but the grilled corn is also delicious, it's been printed one by one so it's easier to eat, the onion rings are not bad either,

the service is okay, friendly and good too, maybe because it's a bit crowded, okay, for student pockets it's also worth it, but because it's a family here, it's okay, it's safe, and the location is next to the main road, so it's easy to find, that's okay , thankyou, success continues and maintain the service and taste

Roti Bakar Om Doel in Sawojajar, Malang is a place to eat that is worth a try for toast lovers. The price offered is very affordable, so you don't need to worry about spending a lot of money. The taste of the toast here is very delicious and satisfying, especially with the variety of toppings that you can choose according to your taste.

This dining area is also quite spacious and has a comfortable atmosphere, so it is perfect for enjoying toast with family or friends. Unfortunately, the service here is rather slow and unsatisfactory. However, this does not reduce the quality and taste of the toast offered.

The mint tea is delicious and very fresh. Ask for less sugar but still sweet. The place is small, you can't hang out, there are only long benches for sitting. The place is rather small but crowded because it is in the campus and boarding house area. The parking lot is a bit cramped on the road if it's just for motorbikes it's enough, for cars it's rather difficult

Drink shops with quite affordable prices, there are various kinds of variants ranging from fruit variant teas, fresh milk, and yakult mixes are also available.

Order the passion fruit tea, orange juice and Thai tea variants, request less sugar but still sweet. Maybe you can reduce the sugar content a bit.

For the passion fruit tea, it would be better if it had the original passion fruit pulp, so it would be fresher.

In terms of service, including fast, yes, the packaging is also okay

I like Glek's mint tea, the mint is quite strong...

Good place

It was the first time I went to a vape store in Malang, and my expression was WOW WOW WOW. Why? According to me:

1. The location factor, it's very comfortable here, the room is air-conditioned, the atmosphere is relaxed, the arrangement of the place is minimalist and neat so that it is ""eye-catching"" with the products being sold, but there are still minuses starting from the lack of seats so that it is less supportive for a place to hang out and share knowledge after buying a product or just sharing with the owner.

2. Service factor, TOP MARKOTOP, the owner is super friendly to me who is illiterate in ""vaping"", he still gives knowledge in a fun and easy to understand way, so I understand and am satisfied with the questions I asked the store owner, he too Patiently answering my questions, even though I actually understand a little.

3. Product factors and product prices, in this case I am still okay with the products being sold and offered to me, because the prices and products here are almost all vape stores selling what this shop sells, I haven't found any rare products being sold here or maybe I don't know which products are rare or not.

Conclusion:
I give this shop a score of 95 out of 100 because it's not from the location and product factors, but from the friendly and ""friendly"" service, I feel like I'm talking to my own friends

Suggestions and critics:
To store owners;
Please extend your store's opening hours so that customers who don't have time in the morning or afternoon can visit your store at any time.
Please add seats for customers so they can linger, the goal is to feel comfortable and be able to share knowledge with fellow vape users and with you as a shop owner.
If you have added a ""hanging out"" facility, don't forget to make it complete, provide soft drinks for your customers to buy, so that it will be more comfortable and crowded with customers.

That's all from me, thank you for your service

There must be >8 angkringan vendors in this space. The space is quite big, so no worries to get a seat.

Menu is about the same from 1 vendor to another, just choose which one you feel drawn to.

Angkringan food usually consist of:
‚Ä¢ nasi bungkus (packed rice in smaller portion)
‚Ä¢ indomie (best instant noodle in the world)
‚Ä¢ sundukan (meat on skewers)
‚Ä¢ wedhang (hot drink like coffee, tea, ginger)

I didn't have much time, so only had some sundukan.

I must say that the KAI did the whole space really nicely. There's even locker & shower amenities in the stretch of Slasar Malioboro.

Craving for wedang ronde so I decided to visit this place.

Great for your diet. I lost five kilos in one night. I recommend a Homestay with your own bathroom ;)

This place is serving one of the most favorite coffee in Jogja, for everyone near this area, I would personally recommend to try Kopi Joss. It's unique and a special coffee, hot coal was added. Affordable and worth it.

It's an excellent place to bring friends, lesehan or sit on chairs are options. The services are nice. Recommended!

For a lot of empty menus, there are always noodles. There are many noodle variants that you can choose the topping for.
I recommend Cwie Mie with gizzard liver topping because it tastes great.
For the drink, I recommend the fresh and delicious iced sunrise.
There is also free wifi here, but sometimes it's slow, besides that sometimes you can smell the garbage, which is about 4 houses from the shop.

Well, this place is not so spacious though. It's rather small for a cafe located downtown.

But their platter which consists of fried broccoli, kind of mushroom, potatl wedges and fried tofu was incredible. It's tasty and the sauce has some kind of unique sweet taste.

Visit this place after it got promoted by a local IG food reviewer. Nothing's special about this coffeeshop. Price are a bit expensive for that size of coffee. Dish needs forever to be served. Can't find a non-smoking table, unless those one outside.

I like the ambience, the drinks are great. I ordered strawberry creamy and ice coffee mantra. The strawberry creamy is basically like strawberry milk with the exact sweetness based on my likes. The ice coffee mantra, which is specialty in this cafe, but I think isn't special because the taste is like basic ice coffee milk *imo*.
The place is great for hang out with your friends, but not really great for those of you who want to be alone, because it's pretty crowded.

Location: 5/5 (easy to find.)
Place: 3/5 (great interior, I like the wall painting and painting in a frame, very creative. But I think, the cafe should put more ventilation, because sometimes customers are smoke in the indoor room. I found it pretty stuffy for indoor room)
Price: 4/5 (affordable prices according to the quality of the food)

Aesthetic place with limited menu to choose. Food is fair-priced considering the quantity and taste.

The price of coffee is very cheap, the taste is great, but sometimes it tastes a little burnt.

The place is pretty cozy, the arrangement is good. It's a shame the drinks are very, very lacking. There are only 2 kinds of coffee on the menu and it doesn't taste like coffee at all, maybe some kind of coffee-flavored powder drink and mostly water. It's a shame that a place as good as this is but the quality of taste is very lacking, it makes people give up on coming back. üôè

The place is cool, there are outdoor, indoor and semi-outdoor areas with views of the rice fields. The atmosphere is comfortable, the music playing is also suitable for relaxing. It can be used to get together or do chores. The design of the place is also fun for photos. Unfortunately there were several menus that weren't available when I arrived and the prices listed on the menu list were slightly different from the purchase receipt, maybe because they hadn't been updated.

The place is air-conditioned, comfortable for doing college assignments, if behind in the afternoon you can see two moments at once, namely sunset and sunrise

The place is nice, spacious, comfortable. Easy to find too. Service is quite friendly, food serving takes a long time.

Recommended

Suitable for family hangouts because you don't have to go far to town. The location is convenient but when it's busy the service is a bit long because there are only a few employees, and there is no music as entertainment. There is a prayer room and clean bathrooms. The menu is diverse. Prices start at IDR 5,000 for drinks and for food, prices start at IDR 10,000.
It seems there is no wifi. To taste like a cafe.

Recommended to visit when passing or in Malang City, Sukun Village Area.

Not only delicious and comfortable for young people but also for mothers both for social gatherings or friendship among friends, a comfortable place for gentlemen to drink coffee in the afternoon or at night.

Serving various drinks & food and the prices are overall affordable.

The place is spacious, good for hanging out in the afternoon or evening. But hot days are not good.
The menu consists of noodles. For food taste 6/10
What is lacking here is cleanliness. For food it looks open even though it is arranged around the stove. So this is like an ingredient that is about to be cooked and is surrounded by flies. Hopefully in the future please pay attention to cleanliness. Because what goes into the stomach is important. Also, please store the vegetables properly.

It is a nice and home-like coffee shop with very friendly crews. The foods are great, the beverages are delightful too.

great heritage architecture

Cozy coffee shop/cafe in Malang

The ambiance at Golden Sand is comfortable, warm and calm. Interior design is also suitable to be combined with buildings that are indeed Dutch heritage.

For food, the portions and prices are standard and reasonable. As for the taste, it's also delicious, there's nothing to complain about.

Waiter service is also very friendly and smiling. Big applause for the waiter and the barista.

My only complaint might be the different prices between the menu and those on the bill, for some foods the price can go up 10-25k from what is on the menu book. For drinks, it can actually be 2-5k cheaper than the menu book. Maybe the menu book can be updated so that customers can be more comfortable.

Overall, still a great place, great food and great ambiance. Will I come back here? Of course! The comfortable atmosphere succeeds in making me want to come back to taste other dishes. But for now 4 stars first, if there is improvement in the future, 5 stars for sure!

The place is quiet, open and comfortable. Suitable for those who don't like crowds, especially during the pandemic era. Standard food and drink prices. The menu is still not very extensive, but quite varied. The taste of the food is pretty good.

Nice Place and Good Coffee

The taste of the coffee is like warkop warkop in Makassar city, the internet connection is quite fast, suitable for work and hanging out as well as nobar, just a suggestion for the owner, for nobar it's good to provide a big screen like using a projector, so that Nobar is better, success is always for the coffee shop...

The price of coffee is cheap, the snacks are also cheap, the Wi-Fi is fast. Because of that this place is favored by many school children. Especially those who like to play mobile games. Not the right place if you are a person who prioritizes coffee taste. Coffee is perfunctory, but still very suitable for an affordable price. Suitable if you want to take a short break away from the rain. Open until midnight. Crowded on weekends.

I went to this place because I got together with my friends with scholarships from UIN, UM, and UB to discuss work programs. Here not only serves various kinds of drinks and snacks but also facilitates reading books, visitors who come can spend their time enjoying the meal while reading the books that are neatly arranged on the shelves. In my opinion, the service is pretty good, the taste of the drinks is also pretty good, and the prices are also right from 8 thousand to 20 thousand, it's just that in my opinion the place is not comfortable. The chairs were not neatly arranged after being occupied by other people and the table still had traces of the drink from the previous visitor.

This coffee shop is so well-known arround the students in Malang because this place's included as the most productive coffee shops for discussion and another agendas. It's also commonly called as Gusdurian (a group of people who follow the value of Gus Dur, 4th President of Indonesia) basecamp and also the place for meeting and discussion by another communities tho. There are many books in the first floor, and it's actually has 3 floors. This place is not only sold the coffee, but also tea, milk, hot chocolate and so on.

this place live up to its name. it provides light drinks, coffee, and small snacks. there's a decent public library, means you don't need to worry if you forgot to bring your books. wifi are also available if you're in for some productivity tasks. parking is not shaded and it's on the side of the street directly. may not suitable for dating, but best for group discussion.

EDIT: several days ago I went back and found out if you want to do events here you need to secure mininum purchase of several hundred thousand rupiahs. If you cannot do that, they charge you additional money. But not all the menus are available for us to purchase. Most of them are sold out, but they don't care if we couldn't reach the mark, we still need to pay the money. How could we fulfill their minimum purchase, if we cannot order anything? I lowered my points from 4 to 2. Still a good place, but not recommended for meeting.

I went here for a casual meeting with my friend. They ran out of the snack and meals. I could ordered iced taro only. The price was cheap. I was surprised the photo in the Google maps didn't match the reality. The place was kinda dirty. They might haven't mopped the floor for a really long time. There were thick layer of dust above the books on the shelf. I was having my drink in the rooftop. The rooftop was dirty and kinda dark. There were only one or two light bulbs. The toilet was in the second story, it was really smelly and disgusting. Poorly maintained place.

It's really nice to hang out here actually, especially if you host a discussion event or simply want to meet people and talk upon some issues in depth. For this oase cafe regulars are activists and intellectuals.

I was hosting a discussion event inviting some groups several days ago. The management charges us 210k rupiah for minimum purchase.

What really disappoint me is:
1) they didnt explain that there will be minimum purchase before the d-day
2) I was and am really okay with the minimum purchase, it's small amount of money. I was really sure the crowd will exceed the minimum purchase by ordering several drinks and food. BUT THEY ONLY SERVED DRINKS. THE MEALS ON THEIR MENU WERE NOT AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT YET THEY STILL INSIST FOR US MAKING IT TO MINIMUM PURCHASE
(how could you expect your customer to order a bag of air or a plate of disappointment and inconvenient and swearing never come back there again smh)
3) They even didn't let us start our event until we make it to minimum purchase. I do understand that your company pushed you hard to meet our obligation as client, sir. But please: you should have informed me before the d-day and providing solving to the situation too!
4) I was complaining to the management after the event finished, they told me that IF I DIDNT MAKE THE MINIMUM PURCHASE, I HAD TO GIVE THEM THE SPARE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CHARGED US.
Excuse you, sir, but your company fail to cater us the food you promised to serve. And you expect us to get our money for bags of air and plates of disappointment. Thank you.
5) We did make it to the minimum purchase. Although I had to pay for some orders they served wrong.

It is never about the amount of money for me. It is the hospitality this caf√© fail to provide. I have charged for bigger amounts of money at another caf√© and I was really happy.

A Bali vibes cafe in Surabaya.
The food and drink are good enough. The price also affordable.
Therefore, when we go there at noon, it will be very hot. The AC place is not large so enough for only several people.

And there are some of menu poster with low price but only can be ordered at 10PM.

A good cafe with sort of Mediterranian met Bali Beach Club ambiance. The nuance was comfy and relaxing. Quite instgrammable. Depending on the weather, usually it was hot in the noon.
The food & drink were quite good actually. The menu ranged from 25K to 60K. One small problem though, it had limited parking space for cars.

A good vibe cafe. A cozy and comfy one.
Visited here due to some recommendations and here I am on reviewing this place as my first impression herw.
Food and drink: various kind of them. Nasi Bali is recommended (ordered it twice, guys üòãüòÇ).
PRICE: Under 50K IDR I think.
Design: unique and refreshing since it feels like we're not in Surabaya.
Additional offer:
-. Snack like cinnamon rolls, brownies, etc. are offered here.
-. There's a thrift shop at the corner of this place with affordable price also (start from 25K and 30K).

Go check it out, guys.
Have a good time!

A cute tiny tropical cafe in Surabaya but feels like in Bali. The interior design is really beautiful. They sell light snacks and beverage. Only have 3 menu for heavy meal. Their cookies is pretty delicious. The cleanliness is not really good, I mean, not the stuffs or foods. I found a very big bold spider in the indoor area and a little flying-bug inside tissue box, but i believe they come from outdoor area, it's nature. Hope they care more about the bugs that shouldn't be in indoor area.
I recommend you guys to come when the sun is going down, because the temperature in Surabaya at noon is really uncomfortable.

Dear Management, sitting with coffee.
Permission to provide criticism and input.
My first time coming here, intending to do an assignment.
The place and menu are highly recommended.
However, please maximize the service by front/cashier, because when I went there in front of the cashier's desk, I only saw it, (ignored) and wasn't asked what to order, and when I ordered a drink on the menu it said 10k and the cashier said 12k ( 12k receipt, its different then)

When I ask why the price is different? The cashier just replied ""I don't know, Miss, in the application, this is it"" with an unfriendly tone to answer it.
Well, I just paid then, even though it felt uncomfortable with his attitude.

Incidentally at that time the cashier who served the mas who was a bit ""fat"" (I'm sorry I mentioned)

The concept raised is monochrome (simple black and white).

The hangout location this time is on Jalan Kadaka. Very close to ""Provincial road"" Soekarno Hatta road, Malang. less than 5 minutes from the main road before reaching Dan's Kitchen.

Before entering, there is a sweetener on Dan's right and left wall designs that you can use to take pictures/selfies etc. In the form of flowers with a choice of beautiful colors.

The facilities provided are also quite complete. Free Wifi, AC room, toilet, prayer room and a representative parking lot as well as power plugs. Indoor and outdoor table options are also available. Whether you come with work friends or just the two of you with your loved ones, everything is facilitated at Dan's Kitchen.

The menu choices are very modern and friendly to students, which is the main target of Dan's kitchen. Heavy meals, snacks, soups and drinks are also quite diverse.

There is always something that can be improved at this hangout location, you can add a choice of delivery providers such as (go-jek, grab, etc.) and a pointer to a restaurant on the side of the road.

Located near the Red Bridge, opposite the PTPN (PT Perkebunan Nusantara) building which is still very authentic and impressed by the Dutch building and close to the Prime Mister Bank whose building is still authentically Dutch. So it can be a photo-able place.

Here it is not only Angkringan Baladewa, along this angkringan there are other foods.

Maybe this is subjective from me, it's better if the spicy soy sauce is used as a seasoning when burning the food. So that it is more taste and delicious in its various burnt. There are various kinds of food such as skins, injuries, wings, intestines, sausages, and many more. But the owner's nephew said the best thing was the Nasi Bakar. The price is definitely affordable.

Maybe the drawback is that it is close to the river, so at night there are mosquitoes. It's not much, it's just there.

So what are you waiting for, come to this Baladewa Angkringan and try the Nasi Bakar.

It's really worth the place to hang out. The atmosphere is cool, clean and very comfortable.

It feels good. Hygienic place. And the most important thing is COMPLETE INTOLERANCE.

A lot of the food is not ready. When I ordered it, it was like guessing the menu with the cashiers. Want to order Nasi A, it turns out it's not ready. It was explained that there was only BCDE rice. Then I want noodle soup with eggs, no.
It was explained that there was only a dimsum menu, and even then only a few were ready stock.
But I don't want dimsum anymore. Skip.
Then I ask again, is there toast? Nothing either.
Are there french fries? Nothing either.
Then explained that there were only burgers, cireng, and bananas. Finally, order cireng.
With that price, my expectations are quite high for the qty of cireng that will be served. Eh, oh my God, it turns out that the portion is very small :""(

The concept presented at this caffe is very unique bestie. From the outside, it looks like the small cafe is only in one black box, but behind the black box, there is a seat with a garden theme. Wow, a bestie who likes greenery or likes natural things will find comfort when she comes to that place and the bestie doesn't expect that there is a seat similar to the old house, duh, the concept of this cafe is so comfortable to just chat or bestie wants to tell a story.
For me, I like the natural concept the most because it's outdoors and not boring. Bestie also definitely didn't expect that it turned out to be a batik gallery next to it. Wow, the characteristics of Pekalongan are very revealing. Apart from that, the prayer room provided is also quite comfortable because I also like to stay in the prayer room for a long time. The model is similar to an ancient house with brown paint. It's really fun isn't it. Don't worry, bestie, the coffee that is served is also delicious, at that time I ordered Americano and well, for coffee fans, this caffe is quite recommended, especially for assignments.

The drawback is that the service is a bit slow. So, just be patient, it's worth the time‚ú®

All about rice. You must try it for culinary lovers, especially in Malang. Many variants of Snack and rice bowl are on the menu.

Just a suggestion, maybe the cooking can be accelerated. Because I often get orders here, the cooking takes a long time. And for drinks, it's better to use a sealer, even if you don't have a sealer, it's better to just wrap it in plastic. Because if you use a cup, it will spill, even if the cup is wrapped in a plastic strap, it still spills a lot.

Not worth the money, the food is pricey while the taste is not that good, chicken cordon blue (69k) the chicken was dry, the sauce is tasteless, and just a regular potatoes fries; tamie (65k) was ok

I think Artap has a unique concept with artificial plants. So you can feel nature (outdoors) and indoors at the same time. Super comfy to spend time with family or friends. Available many foods and drinks variant also serving food with great looks

The atmosphere is great. What I like the most about this place is it has books to read and various handcrafts and art to display and sell. I think it's a nice move. This place is so artsy, beautiful and cozy place to hang out and have quality time with loved ones.  But this restaurant needs to improve the taste of their foods. üòÅ

The food & drinks aren't that many which is a bit of a letdown, and the space of the cafe isn't that big, and the parking space is kinda tricky if you bring a car here

This place allows you to enjoy gelato while being accompanied by lots of cats.

The flavour options are decently varied with several drinks menu also. There weren't any way we could order food for the cats however during time of visit. The service was okay.

There are enough seating available and decent parking space.

There are various cats going around. There are also some hedgehogs nested on some of the tables.

This caffe is for you who love cat but dont have time to keep it at home.
This is my first time come grooming my cat. While waiting I can play with cuties cats here. They are friendly cats you can cuddle them but some also not keep miaoming when I close to him.
The caffe dont have much menu to order .  They said kitchen dammage. Is small caffe and no cat playground for jump etc

There are a lot of cute cats, but the strong smell of cat's letter box really made me unwilling to stay inside. Really hope they can manage good ventilation to reduce the smell, or perhaps putting the litter boxes in separate rooms.

We came here for the first time. The first impression, this place suits truly for cat lovers. The customers can play with the kitties while having a meal. But it's not working like that on us.
While we'd had our dinner, they jumped over our low table. We just concerned on the tidiness of the foods from the cat's fur.

The thing I love about this restaurant is that it offers smoking and vaping which located inside the restaurant.
The out-side of the restaurant is designated for non-smoking area.

I picked Soto and quite disappointed by the meat as most of the meat isn't meat but tendons. The meat is a bit ""beefy smell"" as well.

Most of the food is just standard for something quite pricey. 6,5/10

#bossmanreviews

my fav cafe in Ciworld due to their menu is familiar in my son's taste. He's really likes Bakmi Goreng. And their croffle menu was great too! And their menu's plating was great as well ... keep it up!

Ordered this ""happy cup"" via gojek. The taste is very good with a very affordable price, only around 22k to 26k per portion.  Comes in a quite big portion too. They only do ""happy cup"" for gojek only not for dine in. I love the dory sambal matah, the sambal matah tasted fresh. I love that they put the sauce and pickles in a separate plastic so the chicken will not get soggy from the sauce.

Delicious food, great service. There are smoking area inside. So this place is also comfortable for non smoking person. They also have a plethora beverage, which is also delicious. I tried teh tarik and i recommend it to try.

The place is really cosy and well decorated, pretty original. The waiters were quite friendly and did not hesitate to ask their colleague when they didn't know the answer to some of our questions.

Aconk cafe is located in the Veteran Street No.61 Jetis, Lamongan. The place is very comfortable. Moreover, it is used for get togethers with friends. There are many menu choices. There is a varied drink and food menu. The service is fast, the prices are affordable, and sometimes there is life music too, so that makes us enjoy the atmosphere there more. There are 2 floors, on the first floor the wall pattern design is very good for photo use, as well as on the 2nd floor. And when we are on the 2nd floor, we can enjoy a beautiful view from above. Some of the menus sold there for example, various kinds of coffee, juice, tea, crispy tofu and many more. And the taste of the food and drinks sold there is very delicious.

There's board game that you can play (like uno and domino), wifi, and power outlet.

I love this place. Their coffee is quite good and they can make anything coffee based. I still prefer single origin tho, but their white is also great. Fingerfoods are average but when you got coffee, you can never fail with fried banana.

The price is very affordable and it has spacy room for your friends, families, or your partner.

I suggest to go here in the afternoon as they don't have room with air conditioner, and all areas are smoking areas, so think twice before you bring your baby here. (Who will bring baby for a coffee tho)

Iced black was not the best, but it was v enjoyable. The creaminess of the Es Kopi Susu Candu was great, but the overall taste was not my fave. White was bitter and watery somehow.

Cheesecake can have more tartness to it, martabak croissant had good flakiness considering the fillings, fried rice was good and the spices actually stood up, chicken parm was okay.

The milky orange cat was the best!!! üòª

They need smaller tables in the non-smoking areas so ppl wouldn‚Äôt feel too guilty for having the whole table for themselves when they prefer not too sit among the smokers.

the place is separated into smoking and non-smoking room. thats great.
wifi is also great.
but one thing i do reaaaallly mind is about the flies.
ugh..maybe because its located near the traditional market, but owner need to think this over and solve this flies problem.

Coffee taste is good. But, need improvement about service quality for customers.

The place is good. Food are moderate. I like the burger, but not for the rice bowl. The coffees are also good. The only thing I mind is about the seatings.

Picture above is the environtment of the time I get here with friends. They are are arguing about the price and which items has been ordered and not.

The place is decent I would say, I especially loved the interior and outdoor settings. The cafe has transformed the dutch building with blue and white stylings. Quite different what you easily see, for me the architecture stand out when I was driving my motorcycle, piqued my curiosity.
The coffee was fine, not the best. Expecting the manual V60 Japanese brew to be more delicate but it‚Äôs mainly depend on the barista to bring out the taste.

I think this is one of those cafes where you can spend time chatting with a group of friends. Well, it's great for couples too but I think the vibe is not so much suitable for that.
First time at Hindia, we ordered hazelnut latte, some kind of tea and their platter menu. Well, I can't say something special about those three menus.
But I think they need to reconsider putting away those tables placed on the outer side of the outdoor area.

It is a coffee shop and eatery as well. Coffee is basically prepared from a group of selected beans with a coffee machine; so there is nothing special. The menu is rather complete, offering main dishes and snacks. The price is affordable and the location is strategic.

Good beverages. I ordered avocado coffee and it's pretty okay-ish. The food surprisingly came out really good. We ordered kwetiau and banana fritters.

If youre looking place that offered very spacious place, with good ambience and minimalistic design but price doesn't matter and the foods are edible this is the place.

really enjoyed it, and there was a varied food and drink menu, the service was quite friendly, the room was very clean and comfortable. happy visiting ...

My aunt and uncle invited me to Foresthree. It seems like a nice place to hangout and chat with friends. There's a bunch of unique foods you can choose from their menu. I ordered a bowl of noodles. It tasted good, but I prefer their non-indonesian dishes.

The second time I came, I ordered Fettuccine Carbonara, and it tasted good. They have a pretty big variety of snacks or side dishes. They taste pretty good too. They have kind of small portions for an average main course, so if you're really hungry, you should order some snacks or side dishes to go with your meal.  The drinks are okay, but it's too sweet for my tastebuds. I would come here again with my friends, though. I recommend this place for hanging out with some friends or people.

The setup of this place is the reason behind those 5 stars. Food is good too.

The coffee is admittedly somewhat nice. The milk is fresh and goes side by side with the coffee is a regular cup.

Nice place, instagramable. Lots of interesting photo spots. There are outdoor and indoor too. For the second floor specifically for suki and grill. On the first floor there is a small prayer room.
Yesterday we were treated to suki and grill, haven't tried the other menus, are they delicious or not.
There is an inscription on a special parking space for kachi, haven't had a chance to see it because yesterday it was parked on the side of the road.

A cafe that is suitable for gathering with family and friends

The portion is also medium, not too small/too big; just right.. My favorites are Choco milk and Brown sugar milk. Recommended.

TEA BREAK really deserves 5 stars from me! the place is really big and in my opinion the booth is the widest than the other drink stands. the employees are friendly. no one is jutek like that. really really fun. the cup seal is strong. I once bought a lot and until the house there is no leak at all. it still tastes good too. My favorite is the matcha milk variant! it's really good, it's cheap again. really don't disappoint. tea breaks also often hold giveaways, you know, friends. Try to follow Instagram, I'm sure there will be lots of promo announcements or Gitcuu giveaways. anyway, for all of you boba lovers, you really have to try a tea break!

There are various drinks here which I think are quite fresh at affordable prices. Starting from pure tea to milk tea, there is. Student price range. It's located on the top floor of MOG's Foodcourt.

Yep, definitely will never coming back.

coffee shop with a view of the train tracks. in my opinion the price is relatively expensive when compared to the taste served.

The taste was okay. But i dont think it's worth the price, cause the portion was small.
They have indoor and outdoor setting. But the indoor was to dark and gloomy. The only good thing was the outdoor (cause you can see the train), but you will absolutely can't use it if it were raining outside.
They played the music out loud to the point of annoying. I spend time to work there, and have a meeting. But they didn't even bother to decrease the volume.
And don't forget the music wasn't suite the cafe vibes.
And also lots of mosquito, if you stay there past 5pm.

Hope the cafe improve its quality, vibes and service.

A place to hang out right in front of the Lucky Suropati stadium. Here provides snacks and drinks. On this occasion I had the chance to try the cappuccino and cireng milkshake. The drinks and snacks here are pretty good, but the milkshakes are a little too sweet. The cireng is delicious, even though it's cold it's still delicious and not mushy. The price is quite relevant to the given place. Overall 7/10 for the location, mamin and vibe.

A very strategic location on Jl Pahlawan Kota Pasuruan in front of UNTUNG SUROPATI STADIUM. Line up with Nelongso fried chicken outlets, order coffee, ice baskets. For those who miss the atmosphere of Jogja, it's very appropriate to chill, hanging out here. The menu is a typical Javanese menu of very varied food and drinks at friendly prices. Keep obeying the health protocol, ok? Hand washing is also provided here at several points. Enjoy and Let's Talk.

ADVICE FOR OWNER!!!
the place is quite good and comfortable, but criticism is for the waiter so as not to shout the name of the buyer.
Can each table use a number as well as anticipate the splash of saliva on the food that is not closed when the waiter shouts the name of the buyer to find a place to sit....,

Here the coffee tastes different from other memorable coffees, the body is too bold, too strong, seems to use a different blend of coffee, like using robusta coffee, or maybe it was just a one time accident when I ordered it in the morning via ojol.

Try it for the first time and order via grabfood. This time, the order is iced coffee from memories of the former + iced chocolate runaway. The iced coffee from this former memory tastes okay for me, who doesn't really like coffee, taste 8/10. But for the big no ice chocolate, the taste is far from expectations. Compared to pure cocoa, it has ch*time so much taste. Taste 7/10.

Although I bought it when they had promo. 50.000 for one small cup. But I expected the taste from the yogurt was exactly like a yogurt and It taste just so so. But it's nice though to mix your own flavors and toppings freely.

Just try their beverages.

Delicious, take it yourself, choose your own taste, 1 cup regular 50,000 during the promo, I like the white original plain tamarind flavor the best, only the toppings for those in the package cannot have fruit toppings, those that are allowed non-fruit toppings. Finished select will be weighed.

My husband and children really enjoy coming here. There are often promos, take as much as you like in 1 cup (can be up to mount) for only 50k. The chocolate and cheesecake flavors are really like ice cream, you don't feel like eating frozen yogurt. Perfect for those who don't like acid. But if you want the yogurt taste, you can try the plain tart. It's sour, and not too sweet either.

First, the water wasn't clean. It was dirty. I know it was from the source (When I open the faucet, the water is dirty). But you can consult with PDAM about it.
Second, is the french fries taken from freezer and you cook it anyway? And macaroni was too soft. I hope you can fix these foods soon.
For customers, it's still worth to have lunch/dinner here. The ambience is great, the taste is upper-mid, and I think this place is instagramable.

Good place for meeting friends but terrible place for dining. Price of food is ridiculous while quality is not good enough. I spent Rp.8k just for a bottle of 300mL mineral water. Also the main food is not what I expected.

Either lower the price or make it more worth the price

Otreb is a warkop (""warung kopi"", lit. coffee stall) that serves kopi tubruk (just grounded coffee and hot water, no special brewing techniques). They claimed ""kopi giras"" as their specialty coffee, which I suspect was a variety of Javanese robusta. Other warkop drinks such as iced coffee and other sweet drinks are also available.

They also served nice condiment: deep fried tempe tepung which tastes good together with the petis. On top of that, the price range is really cheap! They open 24 hours and have a lot of electric terminal in case you need to charge your phone (I believe it's a popular spot to play MOBA with your team because of this).

This is where real Indonesian working class get their coffee and hangout with their friends, similar to the concept of pubs in Europe.

I was very happy to visit this cafe. I personally think they start the first thematic cafe in small city like Mojokerto and they have nailed it. They have a very warm decoration which remaind me with home. The place is very comfortable and nice for hangout but the most important thing is they give us a taste that is very similiar with many famous cafe in big city like Surabaya. My recommended dish here is their chicken with spinach and enoki mushroom.

‚ñ™Nice place for chitchat with instagramable decoration.
‚ñ™The food is tasty, but just average for the drinks (especially the coffee).
‚ñ™Recommend the risol (only available in limited stock per day).

Quite possibly the best place to eat out in Mojokerto. The food is on the higher end of the price scale, but with quality to match it. Everything tastes nice and delicious. The space is a bit cramped, though, unless eating outdoors.

The only downside is that there's only a few electric plugs available if you want to use your laptop. If you got some friends with you, may I suggest to bring your own cable roll since there's a nice big table for a co-working space.

One more thing, this place would be even better if they expand their tea selection. And add some ginger-based drinks too, it's really cold at night.

Just right for me to smile and nod, fresh and cool with the mood, perfect for knowing if it's alive and processing it for the better, healthy, especially important.

The place usually used by the youth of Blora city to get together. These places line the length of the square and are always busy. Open from evening until almost dawn. In the middle there is a playground for children such as toy cars. The menu provided is cat rice, noodles, fried foods with coffee, orange and tea drinks and milk. Prices can be cheap. You can hang out in this place while waiting for the bus from Surabaya with the last stop in Kab. Grobogan (Purwodadi) if you want to go to Semarang early in the morning. The last bus is around 2.30.

It's a place for young people to hang out. Suitable for gatherings with friends, groups, forums, groups, to discuss anything. Provides a variety of drinks and food.

Good

Actually in terms of location, this cafe already has advantages & wins a lot. But seen from several other sides there are a number of things that are a minus value.

The positives: the location is very strategic, in the heart of the city / main wooden protocol road, access & parking right on the edge of the main road. From here, it's easy to go anywhere & surrounded by complete public facilities (ATMs, shops, etc.).

What is inconvenient: access from the 1st floor to the 3rd floor which is steep & not recommended for the elderly & children, even teenagers have to be careful so they don't slip, especially while carrying trays of coffee & snacks. The view of the city from the balcony is also not optimal because it is blocked by cables & electricity poles which are very crowded.

For variations in the price of drinks & snacks, it's not bad for a cafe in the city center area, even though it's still a bit burdensome for school children's pockets. Btw, the delicious cheese bread makes you full & the chocolate ice is fresh.
Maybe that's all for now... hopefully in the future it will be even better 24/12/22

The service is fast and the price is cheap. Subscribe to buy this from junior high school until I'm already working, it doesn't feel like it's ever changed. The employees are also friendly. Payment can use debit, e-wallet, cash. Here also sell asaka rice

Like Cincau Station in general. Affordable prices with many flavors and delicious taste.

Drink recommendations for me other than the original ones are Honey Lime and Kahvi (if you want coffee)

The Cincau Station here does have its own indoor space apart from the outside foodcourt seating, but it's a bit small. Plus their queue is in front of the entrance, so if it's crowded, it's a bit difficult and seems crowded.

Quite good and the place was nice.

the parking area is good enough, and you get the same value with the price

First, the strength of this cafe is the place. Located in the Kahuripan Nirwana area, this cafe is far from noise and of course the environment is beautiful. The interior is also really good for you freelancers who want to meet with clients. Or for those of you who are looking for a place to rest with doi after a week of work here, the original place is comfortable, clean and cool. Because for Mimin, the cleanliness or aesthetics of the place to eat is also a mandatory thing for enjoying the food itself.

Next, for food, Mimin ordered Indomie carbonara and Boba pancakes. Mimin, first tell me about Indomie carbonara, so Indomie carbonara is a kind of Indomie noodle soup. Mimin thinks this uses Indomie curry, which is given milk and topped with eggs and ham. According to Mimin personally, based on the experience of eggs, there are a lot of gangs bubbling up, I'm sure you guys will be happy if you like eggs. But unfortunately when I ate the ham it was a bit sour.

The boba pancakes are really cute in terms of the plating, the boba isn't hard to chew either, but the problem is at the level of how soft the pancakes are, which according to Mimin, personally, is a bit lacking.

Continue drinking, Mimin when I was there ordered brown sugar boba and Regal milk. It's a favorite, if Mimin goes there, she will definitely order the drinks because they have delicious drinks too, according to Mimin. Moreover, the brown sugar boba is great

So guys what are you waiting for, go and check this cafe

The food is delicious, yesterday when I was there I ordered a black burger. The size is so big that I don't know how to eat it. In the end, it's really messy and I don't like to eat it lol. There are quite a lot of choices, ranging from bread to rice. The portion is also not bad, you could say it's a lot, but it's quite full. The dessert choices are also many and really delicious! Starting from warm to cold. The waffles make you want to come back again, especially with added ice cream. The concept is also cute, you can see it from the location, menu names and food presentation. So the food and drinks are quite Instagram-able, definitely something that we're looking for, right? Not to mention the decorations that can be used as a place for photographs. It's a good place to hang out with friends or hang out with your partner, because there's also musical entertainment here. Eat well without a broken bag. Unfortunately, because of its location in a residential area, it's difficult to park if you bring a car. For motorbikes, I think it's quite safe, because there is a motorbike parking space. Now it's difficult to bring a car, because usually there are already cars around the owner of the house parked in front of his house. So the consideration is that if you go there, always look for a quiet hour or day, because you are sure that it will be difficult to find a parking space. But I'm sure you will come back and come back again.

The unique setup of the shop required me to bring my own cup of coffee up to the upper floors, as they did not provide saucers.  While this was a bit of an inconvenience, I appreciated the environmentally friendly approach.
Despite being the only customer at the time, the view from the top floor made up for the lack of atmosphere. The view of the city and surrounding hills was breathtaking and added to the overall experience. The coffee itself was average in taste, but the view and the novelty of the ordering process made it memorable. 3 stars for the coffee and 1 extra for the view and unique experience. If you're looking for a change from the typical coffee shop experience and a great view, I recommend checking it out.

What's unique here is that they don't provide kobokan, but wet wipes. In addition, it is also plastic-less, the plates and cups are made of paper and there are no straws. The price is standard tourist attractions.

Located near the entrance to the western part of Kepatihan. One of the lesehan in Malioboro which is a bit different, because it uses a paper box instead of a plate, without a bowl filled with water for washing hands (instead each table is provided with wet wipes), glasses also use paper cups, I think this is something good in the context of reduce water usage. The menu is also quite complete with competitive prices. I like the fresh vegetables which consist of boiled cassava leaves and kenikir leaves, pieces of cabbage, cucumber with sweet but spicy chili sauce. I ordered iced tea and iced lemon tea but they taste like instant tea and lemon tea .The place is clean, service is fast.

One of the culinary delights in the food menu, tastes just right, the price is relatively affordable. The service is friendly and fast. Once I tried dinner here, the fried clams were great, the taste was just right. The place is also clean, minimalist and cool, attracting the attention of many tourists. It is located right next to the gate of the Kepatihan Ward Complex, Jl. Yogyakarta Malioboro.

Even 1 star is really good. Food not good. Expensive. The rules don't make sense. Pigeon meat is tough. Can't get water to wash hands. There are no straws for drinks. don't use a plate. it's a mess anyway. Not worth it. Never eat here.

Is it really wobbly or is the fish cracker shattered, isn't it? To answer curiosity so we decided to give it a try. The first impression is the standard cleanliness of the tent stall. Mayan prices are cheap for the size of the area where several hotels are located. Soto ordinary 10,000, rawon 15,000. And after ordering, it's recommended. The koyahnya koyah hakiki (roasted from grated coconut) so that the fresh, savory soup is even more savory. The 3,000 coffee is pretty good, thick and not too sweet. The milk coffee isn't really recommended: it's easy if the Javanese say, cuer there's no kick of coffee or milk. Maybe it's because the price is only 3000 times... My suggestion is to increase the price of milk coffee by 5000 but it tastes great, so it can give a good impression.

They have wide variety of drinks from Green tea to alcohol. The lychee tea has lychees and it has a mellow taste albeit a bit too sweet but over a it tastes pretty good

The location is very strategic. The menu is vary. There are snacks and various drink such as coffee, tea, milk, and juices. The prices are reasonable. Cars and motorcycles can park at the side of the Mataram Street in front of it. There is a toilet. There is a paid wifi (wifi.id). It's nice.

Easy to access, good spot for having small talks although this is a little space.

this time I will tell you about my experience and what I feel after visiting this cafe. The first time I visited this cafe with my junior high school friend in Malang, he to be the one who told me about this place. okay, at that time we visited this place at 10 pm, this place is still crowded, it just so happens that this cafe has 3 floors, the first floor is the cashier and also a few tables for visitors, then on the 2nd floor is an indoor room where this room is covered with glass, lots of tables and mostly used by students who want to do assignments. because on the 2nd floor there is no smoking allowed. so it is very comfortable to work in focus. on the 2nd floor there is also a toilet whose design is very futuristic and of course interesting. okay, because at that time I sat on the 3rd floor there was a lively atmosphere, lots of people hanging out with their friends because the rooftop on this floor allowed smoking, there is also a bar here and there are lots of tables on the 3rd floor, we can also see the city lights. and the service at this cafe is quite good, the employees are friendly, but because the place is very busy it makes them a bit of a hassle.

I just passed through Malang and so happen got tired and get some rest here. The cappucino was meh, it taste like instant coffee. The ice cream was nice, I buy kopyor ice cream and it's decent for 15RB price. Not so sweet just as I like it. The place was spacious. Lot's of collage students there getting some work done. Pretty cheap and cozy fast internet and clean. I went to 3rd floor and since Malang is kinda cold that day it's really nice. Overall 7/10. Maybe after taste some dishes I could increase it. Maybe next time

Cheap food and coffee, wide and comfy, dont use 3rd floor if it sunny.. too hot. Okay when at night

WOW is one of the cafes located in Malng City. With a very aesthetic location and suitable for doing tasks because of its convenient and cool location.
There is also live music so we don't get bored to hang out there. However , the prices there do not match student friendly , students and even boarding children like me with drinks priced above 20,000 Because I think it's expensive.
However, the menu is not boring. The special menu at WARUNK WOW KWB is Rice Bowl, Indomie, Roti Bakar (Rotkar), Coffee which is famous as a cheap menu with priced under 20.000 .

cheap, cozy and rouse, is suitable for just drinking coffee and casual chat with your relatives..

a bit noisy and feels being baked in the afternoon because the location is directly facing the main road. would be better if they have wall made of glass to prevent the heat and reduce the noise

This place available 3 spaces, outdoor, 1st floor w/ kitchenette n 2nd floor (I'm not check yet).
As far as I know, the atmosphere is chilling. Recommended for who want to spend the time in Klaten.

The best place to hang out near the house. The location is okay, there are regular seats and cross-legged. The WiFi, thank God, was smooth when I got there, I deliberately did my assignment here because Indosat's signal was really bad. The location is right in front of the bridge that goes up. The parking lot is not that big.

Here there are lots of drink variants that you can try, ranging from coffee based ones, milkshakes and the like, prices range from 10-12 thousand for drinks. Food prices are not much different. I ordered Red Velvet here, the taste is sweet, more like a strawberry milkshake than red velvet but still OK. Definitely will come back again, because the price is cheap (the most expensive is only 14 thousand cuy), the WiFi is smooth and the place is comfortable.

Cozy yet affordable

Relaxing atmosphere while drinking coffee or enjoying a light snack? Yes, this is a recommended place

Spacious room, there are indoor and outdoor, when the weather is sunny it's fun to go outside while looking at the rice fields across the street. But rainy time is also romantic.

The interior design is dimly lit with indoor plants in various corners of the room, making it fresh and cool. Minimalist paintings and walldecor don't make the room cramped.

The menu and prices are standard places to hang out, don't drain your wallet.
Safe for boarding children üòÅ

Make meetings or discussions really cool, because there is a separate room that can be booked, enough for 10-15 people.

And most importantly, the area is clean and tidy. Visitors also have to maintain cleanliness...

The atmosphere here is good, the place is also comfortable, especially the new building is more comfortable and yesterday I bought delicious affogato ice cream and espresso, I really recommend it.
Suggestions for the seats on the second floor, there are plugs that are really suitable for work, but the seats are not comfortable for senders, so if you want to work for a long time, your back hurts..

Hopefully it can be an improvement for the owner

Some of the ‚Äúsorbet‚Äù aren‚Äôt actually sorbets and yoghurt based so DO taste before you just decide on your flavours! In the end I told the guy what kind of flavours I liked and he recommended the unlabelled ice creams they had which were nice.

Overall Did not like the system of paying first before tasting/knowing what you‚Äôd like , it‚Äôs very unwelcoming

The place is neat, their service was very nice, and the food are quite good for me. It is a recommended place for couple to have some nice chit chat. You can have some delicious authentic Italian gelato provided by Massimo Gelato, and there's 12 options of flavor you can choose. Besides, they also have many options for snacks like chicken wings, french fries, fried tofu, etc. If you want anything heavier, they got pizza and lasagna for you to choose.

Nice cafe n terrace balcony with city view.
Great taste

We went for dinner at Malio Terrace or Massimo Gelato called it whatever you want. Set up is really nice menu is diverse however the service literally did not exist. They don't clean and sanitised tables after customers only pick up the dirty plates and when you ask then fir help they say is a self service. The weird thing is that it is not that they do not have staff, they have plenty however they seem so disengaged and bored that is hard to even get thier attention.

Prices I might say is expensive as you can see from the photos of the menu posted by other customers.

Food is in the best case average, they have a buffet with local food however if you order noodles you will get dry packed egg noodles which is not even remotely close to  even the simple mie cart on the streets of Yogyakarta.

I personally had a burger which came a rare in best case medium rare they never asked my wife that order the burger what temperature I would like to have it. It will not be a problem if the burger was uneatable however I was struggling finding any good flavours while removing the pieces of raw meet between my teeth.
My wife asked them to change and they took it away, 3 minutes later I received my burger and for my surprise it was the same burger that I tried to eat earlier they just put it back in the grill burned it and send it back, let's not forget that when the waiter tried to serve my burger the patty fell on his tray and he tried to fix it with his fingers.

After realising it was the same burger the send tk me I went I request to be changed however it took me more than 5 minutes until I found someone that can speak English.

At the end the burger took more than 30 min to came again on the twentieth minute I just went and ask them to canceled the order by the time we were leaving on of the staff xame running after us with the take away.

I do not understand how one of the biggest hotels in Yogyakarta can tolerate such a service!!!

So I suggest you check the Malang promo often so you know the promos for kamsia boba. The price starts from 18k if I'm not mistaken and the cup is really big. It's really wide. I like the chocolate variant the most!!!

The boba drink is delicious, but the seal on the lid is not strong, so one house is broken. :(

it really tastes like this is the best boba anyway. the price is not expensive but super delicious. the best one is the original brown sugar, I've tried other flavors but it's not great.. this is already delicious, the cheese is ok, the sweetness is just right.. instead of buying another brand which is already expensive, 20 thousand and above, it's not worth it, it's better to just buy this

40 thousand buy 2 get 1 free, cheap, the boba is delicious, it's just that the packaging pays more attention because the order via Gofood spilled a bit 2 cups, the original free one is also no less delicious than the taro boba, the sweetness doesn't disappear ""even I just want to finish it, it's a shame, coz the milk tastes fresh and delicious,

This is my first time buying from this store. Previously in another branch, it seemed okay. I came maybe at 21.15, I really wanted to take away I bought cans to take home. When I want to pay, wow, the reminder is very sharp. ""Can't dine in already."" , ""can't have cash to be cashless"" more or less said like this in a very curt tone. I was just very surprised, why did it have to be so snappy. If I do dine in, I'll definitely ask first if it's still possible or not. Oh, too harsh, no smile at all.

The best

The place is quite spacious, there are indoor, semi-outdoor and outdoor. There is a warmindo concept, choose noodles and toppings according to taste. Current food and drink menu, prices according to taste. The service system is also up to date using an alarm given by the cashier. Service is friendly and quite helpful. The place is also comfortable because it's not too noisy because it's not on the main road. Perfect for dating, casual office meetings, work, or just hanging out with friends. Oh yes, the motorbike parking space is adequate, but not so for cars. My advice is to come at night because it's not hot.

The location is opposite the Giant Kebonsari, in front of the Angkringan Pojok entrance. As for the place, it's pretty good for sitting and relaxing because it's spacious and free parking, there's a toilet too (plus value)

The first time I tried it, it suited me right away, apart from being close to home, the price was cheap/standard 10k and the taste was sip, it was right on my tongue... the taro is sweet, not stingy when giving taro powder. The green tea isn't sweet enough, maybe it's made like gt..next I want to try a different coffee flavour.

Hurry up and join the food delivery order, so you can order delivery frequently

Yes Great...

But the 1st floor is very dull, and the garden isn't exactly a garden, it's just a pavement, facing the garden of a private house ( the owner's house is my guess).

This place can be crowded, especially on the weekend.
Queuing can take a long time..because the only menu is available next to the only cashier, so it takes a lot time just for a customer to pick and pay for their menu. Adding a menu board at the entrance will help cutting the queue time.

Tried the siomay and plain roti maryam. Price is pretty cheap, suitable for young people. But the taste is just average for roti maryam. As for the siomay, for me it taste like a frozen food.

As for the drink, we ordered 3 kinds of milkshake.. vanilla, royal chocolate and choco hazelnut, all are very thin to my taste..too much water..

Waiters need a lot of training communication skill..

For food: it's delicious. It's just that yesterday when I ordered, it wasn't very dry. So there's no ""burnt"" appearance, the impression is that it's just warmed up for a while and also if you don't ask for seasoning, don't add more seasoning..

The place is clean, the place is comfortable, the bathroom is clean, the parking area is spacious, the employees are friendly and there are many more advantages in this hangout place and on the other hand the price is also quite affordable for a hangout place with various kinds of processed coffee which is very delicious at very affordable prices and maybe this is the only place to hang out in the Malang Regency area for the eastern region with the most delicious coffee I've ever found. processed coffee that is very delicious ok That's all and really recommend it for visiting this place and don't forget to review it and also share it with friends So that more and more people know about this place and always make Mariana coffee, thank you",0.7749999999999999,0.0011578764545822,0.4422478868754703,4017,"cafe, regency, comfortable, malang, advantages, mariana, nus, thank, overlapping, maybe"

So far so good

Disappointed with the service

Actually I really support businesses like this, developing local resources, opening up new business opportunities, but if you can give me suggestions, I've probably tried a lot of cafes, maybe dozens of cafes or coffee places in Batang and Pekalongan, because my hobby is trying new cafes My advice, yes, it's good to use local products, but the price doesn't match the quality, it has to be adjusted between the price of the place and the taste of the food, for example mineral water using local products, but in other places using products that are already national, the price is the same, then the ingredients other food. Yes, it's adjusted to the place where I'm sorry, it seems like this, at least when someone comes here, after he comes home, he'll think ""tomorrow invite friends to come back here ah"", not ""yes, just once, sorry, before this just a suggestion, hopefully in the future it will be even better and successful,

Located in the middle of a residential area with wide views of rice fields, it just adds to the pleasure of enjoying coffee under a clear sky. Coupled with the extent of the parking lot and there is a mosque to the left of the cafe, it is quite easy for visitors if they want to pray 5 times a day. I think this is a plus.

The coffee is pretty good even though the service is a little awkward but quick to respond. The cafe also plays music throughout the roofless space.

1. Food is not good enough, all too salty. The prize is indeed cheaper than other cafes. But what if all the food is salty?

2. The playlists all have dangdut music at a very loud volume, even though cafes are usually synonymous with a Cozy atmosphere, not like a famous cake like this. NOT RECOMMENDED if someone works in a cafe/student who wants to do assignments. Because the discussion can't be so loud that the music is dizzy, I can't stand it for long.

3. Why is the electricity, not strong or not. Off on off on off. And it's constant like that, it makes you dizzy, it's not suitable for those with low blood pressure

Experience Details
‚òï : Ice Coquette and Ice Coffee Main ‚ù§
üí∏ : Almost 50k ü§ë
‚è≥ : 15 min order time üëå
üìç : Other Heart Coffee, Jalan Tunjungan branch
üóì : April 2022 (Ramadan)

Krn is one of the tourist attractions so it is very crowded, especially at night. So don't be surprised if your order takes a little longer than average. Cleanliness is maintained and the room is relatively narrow. The concept of the place is like a food court where there are lots of millennial food and drinks in it. So you won't run out of options. The building consists of 2 floors and there are indoor and outdoor rooms available. The indoor room is very crowded usually for waiting for orders.
However, my advice is that it's better to take a walk along Tunjungan Street with your partner, family, children, where there are lots of vintage photo spots.
Along the way there are many freelance photographers. Every photographer has a different fee, so it's better to ask first.

I ordered a coffee variant, Es Kopi Main ‚ù§ which has elements of espresso, milk and palm sugar. Meanwhile, my wife ordered non-coffee, namely Es Centil which has elements of yakult, lychee n mint. I'm not a coffee expert so I think the taste is the same as palm sugar coffee in general. Nothing special. What's special is that the ice is a little but the palm sugar coffee is full ü§≠.
For Es Centil, I feel the yakult is more dominant...and if you want something fresh or fresh, Es Centil can be an option ü•∂.

For the price, yes, the modern Millennial CoffeeShop standard in general, starting from 20k, regardless of the espresso menu.

So, if you want to find Malioboro vibes or a busy night with lots of food and drinks, there's nothing wrong with stopping by Kopi Lain Hati Tunjungan whose quality and credibility has been maintained üòâ.

Every time you go to the new Tunjungan road, you have to stop by here. It turns out that the place is very comfortable above when the night is breezy. If the coffee is different, it's already a mainstay
the miss & the romance.

One of the recommended coffee places in Surabaya. The location is on Jalan Tunjungan. There is an indoor area below and an outdoor area above. The outdoor place is suitable for photos because it directly faces Tunjungan street. For the taste and price, the coffee is standard cafe. There is a car park on the side of the Tunjungan road, specifically at 16.00-19.00 it is not allowed to park on the side of the Tunjungan road.

This place is on the edge of Jalan Tunjungan, right in the Trafficbun, so 1 is the place. The place is okay, the service is friendly, I came here when it was quiet, so yeah, the service is okay. I ordered iced capers if I'm not mistaken. Yes, the taste is pretty good, the chocolate flavor hehehe. The drink is a bit runny, so it's not too thick (the chocolate flavor isn't thick). But because the place is narrow and only a few seats are used, it's definitely a hassle when it's crowded. Hopefully in the future it can be improved even more, thank you üôèüèª

There are quite a lot of menu variants. There are 3 menu categories, namely hot coffee menu, iced without coffee, and iced coffee. The price is standard, like coffee in general. The coffee is fresh, not bad. One of the good coffee places and recommendations for enjoying coffee. The location is close to Traffic Bun.

There is a buy 1 get 1 promo, the menu I chose was brown sugar boba milk & choco hazelnut boba.
I really like it because the bobba is fresh, aka cooked before serving. So when you chew it feels chewy

The taste is pretty good, not bad, it's a type of brown sugar boba which isn't thick so it doesn't taste sour, the boba is quite chewy, at a standard price, it's similar to other modern brown sugar milk boba. If you say it's special, it's not, but if you want brown sugar boba milk it's still quite satisfying. The packaging is pretty good too. Overall, the brown sugar milk is standard and doesn't disappoint.

The waiters are kind. It's a shame that the mall and the market are still very quiet, because of the pandemic. easy and fast.

Good food, best butter coffee, delicious dumpling

Really like the coffee vibes at Kayu Tangan. Especially in Wan Chai, the place is clean, comfortable, and also authentic like coffee with the theme of Chinese vibes in general. For the price, I think it's still affordable, and they also offer a menu of heavy meals and snacks. As for the taste of the coffee, it tastes good, the aroma of coffee is quite strong, and it's not too sweet either. For snacks I bought fried gyoza and spring rolls, for the fillings the meat really tastes good, even the fiber is still visible when bitten, the skin is also crunchy and crunchy. good job!

Try Wan Chai Kopitiam in the Kayutangan shopping district of Malang. The main food is hainan rice & dimsum. The drinks are great. the hainan rice uses grilled chicken, tastes good but the portion is not big enough. I don't like the dimsum because there are lots of young bones.

Not have experienced

Unpleasant incident buying LPG for the first and last time here, never again. I asked the shop keeper to deliver and install the LPG, the person said yes and I paid 18 thousand. Then I said that the stove is on the 2nd floor. Ok. Then it turned out that he couldn't put the new one on and the tube was dripping, and it was really rusty and it was so bad that I was scared. The reason is that the diameter of the lpg holes is not the same, I have to replace the regulator even though it's new. The one who is at home is his wife. I was even told to be honest right when I was in the shop if I was told to put it on and on the 2nd floor. Eh, sir, where if people can do something, there's not much of an excuse, right? Eh, when he finally gave up, he didn't install it, instead he wanted to go home. I didn't say just bring the new LPG because I was afraid it would leak, I had good intentions to just change the shipping fee because it was really close to the boarding house. And my LPG cylinder was still new and actually the regulator still showed that there was content, it just glowed red. The guy chuckled, didn't want to return the money, instead he said yes, I already have enough money, 18,000 I can't get anything. I said, please, if I lose, I won't get anything, instead the hose and stove are removed. Yes, it's better not to be there, it's still on. The point is I'm disappointed, if I say I'm told to be sincere, that's fine, but the way of selling like that isn't a blessing, sir. Not recommended at all. Such shame to ever purchase from this shop

Brown sugar milk tea is really delicious. Usually I don't like heavy drinks (sweet and lots of mixes) like this and prefer to just eat the topping for any type of drink with stuffing in it hehehe. But this one really made me finish the drink too. You can choose less sugar and various toppings. It's just that the price for the toppings is a bit pricey for lovers of the proportion of toppings 70%, drinks 30%, like me.

If only there is another cafe here at Gubeng Lama, I would never come to this cafe. First, the waitress is NOT FRIENDLY AT ALL. She looks grumpy since the first time I arrived, made and order until the payment process. At this stage, I felt not welcome. Second, I need to wait quite long until my order arrived, it's a pity since I just ordered coffee latte and french fries which usually it doesn't take that long. So, again I felt disappointed. Third, my comment goes to the things I ordered. Voila, finally the coffee latte and the french fries arrived at my table. And you know what? The coffee latte was super sweet! It's no more taste like coffee but like melted sugar instead. I got more and more disappointed when I look at the french fries. Oh man! I even not sure if I can call that as a french fries. It's terrible! And the climax was when I am making the payment. For such a terrible service and food, I got to pay A LOT! Oh man, I have no words to express how disappointed I am to have such experience at this cafe. If there is another option to rate this cafe, I would definitely choose HALF STAR or even MINUS one. ONE star is too good after all that I have experienced.

I really hope that the management could make a deep evaluation and commit to give a way better service to its customer. Hopefully, I am the last person who had this terrible experience and none will experience this in the future.

They serve indonesian foods like rawon,  soto ayam,  nasi goreng,  mie goreng,  bakso,  and aome snacks such as french fries,  fried tofu or tempe,  bakwan,  etc.
The drinks are also vary, they have coffee, tea,  juices,  and soft drinks.
It's my second time here and I ordered the same food as my first time üòÅ.
I ordered nasi goreng special.  It tasted different üòÇüòÖ
The first one was much better.

It's okay for cafe/resto at train station, little bit pricey, a lot of menus (rawon, ribs soup, fried duck, fried rice, etc)

Piece of advice for you: avoid this place if you want to find good n tasty food. Affordable foods are not here. Worst is, they do not put price tag on some foods on their menu list, and surprise you pay gargantuan at the casheer. By gargantuan, it means 2.5 times of price you pay for food on train (fried rice on train was 35K, here 85K-see the bill I post here). And that is insane!
That pricy beef fried rice is not special at all. Instead the beef, which served from the tail part, mixed with carcoal (residue from the grill I guess), stiff and challenge your jaw to chew it. And bonus: some fat,  that I suppose is not part of a cattle tail, is there too. If you wonder why I ate here, this is my second time in this station. I just jumped out my early morning train where I holed in for 7 hours straight and the least of food I could stuff myself before while I have to prepare for my next train to Jakarta. Meaning no chance to find more appropriate food (and food court) that serve rice, my primary food item.
So, even if you are foreigners whose advantage over currency rate, just find other places
[Indonesia] nasi goreng buntut yg saya makan di sini tidak se-spesial harganya yg wah üòì. Parahnya, harga makanan yg wah ini gak tercantum dalam daftar menunya. Kafe ini jelas bukan tujuan utk anda yg berkantong cekak, juga bukan utk yg nyari rasa. Termasuk juga buat turis2. Jadi, jika memang lapar dan butuh makan, cari di lain tempat.
