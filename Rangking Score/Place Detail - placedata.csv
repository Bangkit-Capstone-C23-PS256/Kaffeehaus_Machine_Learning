Cafe Sawah Pujonkidul,ChIJr0WKPtGHeC4Rj4h53gHeeI4,"Kawasan Cafe Sawah, Desa Wisata, Krajan, Pujon Kidul, Kec. Pujon, Kabupaten Malang, Jawa Timur 65391, Indonesia","tourist_attraction, cafe, amusement_park, park, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment",4.5,17274,1,"Cafe Sawah Pujon Kidul is one of the cafes located in the Pujon area. This cafe is close to residential areas. Here there are various kinds of food and drinks at low prices. In addition, in this cafe there are also rides for games for children, teenagers and adults. Beautiful scenery and cool weather make people who visit the cafe enjoy the atmosphere there more. The car park here is wide, but tourists who use buses must use a motorcycle taxi service to go to the location, because the parking lot is quite far from the location. Apart from that, there tourists can bring souvenirs such as vegetables, fruit, fresh milk and others because there is a market available for shopping.

Great atmosphere, this place for city folks who doesn't connect to the nature on everyday life. Good place for eating some snacks and talks. They have guide to show the place around. This cafe managed by locals. The access to this is through the locals street so be careful when you go there cause there's kids on the road that play around. They have Guest house on this cafe.
The only downside here is that they play music from the speaker. For people like me who works in the city pak enjoying the silence of nature is better than some bad sound from speaker.

it such wonderful and peaceful place for you having holiday with family and friends. we can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the farming field and having snacks in the middle of farm. we can also buy directly from the farm of vegetables that are harvested ü•∞

Overall the cafe sawah itself is ok. Nice view. Service could be improved for better.
Rather difficult to order and take long time to get the food we order. Taste is standard. Ambience is ok. They also have rooftop area. There are some spots to take a picture (perhaps this is its USP Unique selling proposition).

Price is affordable, eventhough some visitors say the price is expensive.
If you want to go here just for eating, you will be disappointed because it is located inside village tourism area so that to enter/reach the restaurant, you have to pay ticket in the locket (12,5K/person) and parking (10k for car).
Payment : cash in major.

Very good coffee, quite possibly one of the best in town, worth the hype. Must go for double shot if you're ordering espresso. Single shot only if you cannot tolerate coffee.

This place has a strong traditional Javanese vibe to it. Not perfect for working, as it prioritizes on the cozy but great for social hangouts or couple trips.

Very good experience! You can enjoy tasty coffee and another drinks & foods here but don't be surprised coz the price is more expensive than other cafe on it's level.
But... Don't worry coz u will experience quite & locally vibes here, the place is sooo large and many choices for seat & ambiance you prefer.

Unfortunately, this natural vibe isn't consistent because of how they served drink. Just many of their menu are served with single use plastic glass, straws, & etc. Hopefully they will upgrade the service & packaging with more sustainable services üçÄüèûÔ∏èüåç

A big place, joglo style. It is expensive considering Jogja standard. The coffee is around 38-45k. The place can be hot due to lack of airflow somehow. One of the staff was smoking heavily and the smoke blew to our table. The chairs are not comfortable. Internet connection is not too good either, I got disconnected often from Zoom.

Good coffee, well snack, enjoy the ambience. If you want to meet your friend and have a nice conversation, you can go to this place. There are some facilities like park field, musholla and toilet.

Came here because It was on the movie ...
The vibe was alright.
The food was good and incredibly cheap.
Spent almost the entire evening there.
Had a prayer in the musholla, need more cleaning on that department."

My son loved to be able to play with these things.  the food choices are diverse and unique, the taste of the food is very good, although it looks like the portion is small, but it makes you very full. the waiters are very friendly and most importantly the price is affordable!

I was very impressed when the food I ate wasn't what I ordered (because I didn't know it wasn't what I ordered, because I've never eaten it before, but it's still delicious) they replaced it with the right one for free. Thank you!

It looks good from the outside but the service and food is terrible. Cold eggs, cold beans, cold bread. We were told to get up from our table to order two English breakfasts, why can this not be done at the table?

I do not recommend.

Love the ambience here. It feels warm and cozy, the food tastes good too.

I utterly disappointed with this place. The only selling point about this place is if you want to look a proper selfie place. I ordered a manual brew coffe, a dragonfruit smoothie, and an avocado juice. The verdict is as follows :
Cofee = 3.5/5 adequate aroma not that strong
Dragonfruit smoothie= 2/5 too watery, bland
Avocado juice=1/5 don't order this at all
And one more thing, you should carry enough cash because this place doesn't accept any form of payment beside cash.

Nice place if u need work space , i think this a good solution cause in here u get feel homey and staff care to u . Must try salted charamel coffee she staff say  homade salted charamel . Thanks for drink so yummy."

Nice place for family, average taste of foods, friendly staff but they need to give attention for food equipments (glass etc). As the place in Highland... Time to inhale fresh air here, enjoy their green garden and small farm

I like this place because the food and drink was delicious and cheaper than another restaurant, the scenery was great its a combination between nature and modern you can look at my photos here.

I think the view will be better in the afternoon, because it has a field view right beside the cafe. The place is quite spacy
I think the place is more suitable for hanging out and snacking rather than dining even though they have a main course menu, and I heard that the sop buntut is delicious
The service is good and my food and drinks come rather quickly
The price range for food is 25-45k. The drinks are 10-25k. The taste is so so I think, it's not bad, but not really delicious, but I think I'll come here again in the future because of the ambience and views

Has the potential to accomodate your needs of place to hangout when you are coming with quite some nunber of people. The cafe offers various seating options.
Views are ok with the cellery farm and mountains as background.
Drinks and food were just so-so if compared with the price. Mind you they charge tax and services.
Note to management: Freshening up the building might be needed to keep up with the competition..

Lots of seat with open air and you can see the garden, ricefields also beautiful mountain view at the backyard, some food taste good, some other just ok...

Visited this restaurant with family. Beautiful scene on the back yard. Delicious menu available. Just like it, however need more smile from the staff. üòä

Enjoying my iced matcha latte with a view of train station, before I caught my train for a while. It's so close with the railways, so be careful.

The matcha latte, unfortunately, is too sweet for me. Seemed like it had more milk than the matcha itself.

It's really hot in the day. Better come here in the afternoon or evening, because there's no AC. Fan only

This is a must to visit! You sit right by the train tracks in bench seats. If you like some pour over coffee, please order their V60 from the Temanggung area - it is a striking beauty.
The staff is fantastic. We ordered three different V60 for a tasting and look at what they did in the picture...

PANDA LOVES AND URGES YOU ALL TO VISIT

Nice place for a short break and enjoy yogya tranquility.. located right next to yogya train station, decent food but a bit pricey for yogya standard.

Sadly it‚Äôs smoking in every place. Non recommended for family with kids

Atmosphere is great as well as the coffee. The place is clean and comfortable. There is a mosque. Most importantly, you can enjoy the bustling traffic."
BONCAFE RAYA GUBENG,ChIJHdhrVsj71y0RNwXC8yrtS_c,"Jl. Raya Gubeng No.46, Gubeng, Kec. Gubeng, Surabaya, Jawa Timur 60281, Indonesia","cafe, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment",4.7,6114,2,"A well known restaurant for Surabaya citizens. Serving Indonesian, Italian, Western food. They are well known for the steak but the other dishes still could be added up to your preference. The food is well prepared and tastes good as well. Looks simple but flavour sufficient enough to please your appetite.

Price wise moderate to expensive.

The taste and the variety of food, as well as the service are absolutely no doubt and I would say a recommended place to go. The main food that is offer in here is steak-based, from beef, chicken, lamb, and fish. There is also kids menu over here. The portion and the price is proportional. It is good when you want to invite your whole family to have food together.

The service is so fast by the mean the serving time. The place is so comfy and there is outdoor area. The health protocol is properly conducted by the staff that alway make sure everyone check in with pedulilindungi application. The parking is large enough especially for car.

This time I will tell you about my favourite food. That is fried rice. In my opinion, fried rice is everyone‚Äôs favourite food. Because fried rice can be eaten anytime and anywhere.

For example, at breakfast. Based on its history, fried rice comes from the bamboo curtain country, China. People used to cook fried rice because they didn‚Äôt want to throw away yesterday‚Äôs leftover rice. So that the rice is reprocessed with spices to make it more delicious.

However, over time, fried rice is made without the need to leave yesterday‚Äôs leftover rice. Because there are more and more fried rice traders who have quality taste. In addition, variations of fried rice are also increasingly diverse.

I like fried rice, because in addition to the delicious taste, this food can be eaten in various situations. Perfect for breakfast, but also perfect for dinner. And there‚Äôs nothing wrong if you enjoy it during the day.

I like Aceh fried rice the most. Although fried rice does not come from Aceh, the taste of Aceh fried rice is very distinctive. Some traders mix cinnamon, and some Indonesian spices.

Splurge, refined and sumptuous are three words that help wrap up all the dining-in experience I had in this legendary steakhouse. Its freshly prepared classical steak sauce is unmatched. It manages to balance the sweetness, the saltiness of the ingredients to give rise to the distinguished flavor and delicate aftertaste. It pleases the palates, becomes the most sought-after sauce that makes this steakhouse stand out of the rest.

it was my late dinner in their last order but the service still great and the food was delish ! thank you, definitely will come back üî•üî•üî•"

Everything is good. Food is nice, Accessible, nice weather! Nice view. Came here in the evening, should been super nice in the afternoon. Definitely will revisit.

I stayed one night and spend the whole time around NK Cafe. The food was superb, the staff are friendly, the air was cool, great place to spend time with family. There is jacuzzi in the villa, the rooms are fully equipped with amenities. NK also offers variety of activities such as coffee roasting education, gardening and veggie picking which is also safe to directly to be eaten.
One thing I have to mention is safety-ness of the area during rain. Overall, I had great experience here, well done NK!

Cozy place for millenials, food taste were range from 2 to 4 stars, slow response service. Bunga Telang Tea was good.

If you want to bring your family or just hanging out with your friends but you have tight budget, this place may be suitable with your pocket. It offers warm and pleasant ambience, a selected amount of light dishes and affordable price. It comes to my astonishment that they offer a quite tasty meal but cheaper than any other restaurants or cafes. Good job!

nice place, you can get fresh air n good view there. Recomended place for hangout with friends or couple to spend time in afternoon. There are some less tasty foods and beverage in my opinion like you know sausages in noodle menu and traditional drinks ""rempah-rempah"" the taste less good,but over all is okay...

Very cozy and instagram-able place! I guess mostly 'Kera ngalam' (Malang's youth people) knowed this place, because i got the recommendation from my friend in Malang.

The place are very big and wide. Its near from UMM (Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang) campus. There's outdoor&indoor suite room. For you who loves nature vibes, the outside suite room is really high recommended to chosen.

For the menu, there are a lot of food and beverages popular menu, such as 'Pisang Gigit', 'Roti Bakar', 'Hot Chocolate', 'Coffe beer'. I like the 'Kapiten Coffe Beer', you can drunk that beverages safety because its 0% alcohol even using beer as the mixed beverages with coffe. The taste is delicious also.

I gave 5 star without doubtfull, and i highly recommended you guys to visit this place with your friend for hangin' out when you're visiting Malang City!~"

We are already familiar with this place since 2014, then now they have quite spacious place. Unfortunately we found some ... a lot of ''lalat'' here :( and that makes us uncomfortable.
About the food, Soto Kudus they still maintain the taste, and they also provided another menu such as Ayam Kremes, good job!

Food are affordable. Too bad the Teh Tarik that I order is not warm, its more towards room temperature drinks, maybe because the 'tarik' release the heat of the drink itself. Pukis really serve right from the pan, still steaming hot.
Came here during rush hour and raining but still managed to get seat with roof cover. (This restaurant provide open area too). Better they add music in background because it suit with the vibe or maybe some live music.
Bonus : restaurant cat üê±

I've been here for many times. I think Cafe Bali is the most family friendly restaurant in Bandung, especially for dinner. It serves wide-range foods from Western, Italian, and various regions in Indonesia, things that only few competitors have. Love the taste, the portion, its atmosphere, and also the prices.
Recommended menus based on my experiences: tenderloin cheese steak, beef lmentelar, black paper beef spaghetti (I forget its actual name), and garang asam beef oxtail/ribs.

Perhaps a bit over the top decoration but very different vibe coming in here compared to outside. Lots of food option and the soto ayam was tasty.

The place is cozy but too crowded when I came. The food taste very good!

Recommended to everyone üëç

Great place to have meals with your family. Selection is wide, they have Western, Indonesia and fusion. It cater cater to everyone's palate.

Last visit I had the Beef Elmentelar, steak topped with mozarella cheese, smoked beef and a sunny side up. Worth recommending for sure.

Will come back again for more occasions."

Many varians menu and nice place but pricy

Very spacious, it has many table and seats - you can choose from their 3 floors. Food was ok, and drinks also fine. Not the best, but worth the price.

Modern cafe style with extensive menu choice of rice bowl, good appetizer and beverage options. Atmosphere is great perfect for group of friends, teenagers as well as family or adults. Price is reasonable if not affordable. Food is tasty and yummy. The minus? It seem like the place is very popular so expect the crowd specially in the evening. Highly recommended

The place is clean and tidy. The concept is modern industrial and what-they-so-called 'instagramable'. Great taste, I love their beef nahm-jim and lemonade. They know how to cook beef, it just melt in your mouth. The portion is just right for me, but it could be too little for those who have high appetite. Overall this place deserves thumbs-up.

We really like the ambience of this cafe.

Worth waiting for. Coffee was good. Food was good. The place was good as well. I ordered macchiato coffee and quesadilla, meanwhile my friends ordered rawon and other food..my friend comment their Rawon is delicious too. I like the place because it's kind of unique as well..looks like it's adapting the javanese culture with their own philosophy.. It's a good experience coming to this place.

Great place for coffee lovers: many different types of coffee, different brewing methods. Great choice on the food menu, local and occidental.
Not everything on the menu is available though, not everything served corresponds to the description or the pictures shown.
The staff hardly speaks English.
We had the caramel mocha, the praline hot cocoa with marshmallows, pancakes stack (all delish) and fries with cheese & jalape√±o sauce (disappointing).

One of the best cafe I‚Äôve visited. But slightly on the pricey side.

Nice spot for chilling and having dinner. Place is nicely decorated. The food taste great, the service is awesome. Toilet is available and very clean.
Personally I'm amazed with the orchids, I thought it is artificial turns out it is real plants.

excellent and interesting spot. huge space, with many different seating areas. in the back there‚Äôs a furniture making business apparently. the craftsmenship is quite good and the prices affordable for the size of the pieces. cool concept. food is fine, nothing amazing, but drinks were good. huge parking area. recommended.

The place was spacious and lots of open space, you can choose whether to sit indoor or outdoor.  No reservation needed but since PPKM all restaurants including this place close at 10pm and the last order is at 09.30pm.  Sorry, I have to honestly give 3 stars because in my opinion the prices of food and drinks with taste quality were not comparable.  Elsewhere with the same price range we can get better taste.  I think the quality of the taste of food and drinks needs to be improved, including the coffee.  But this place is quite interesting to be used as a photo spot.

Good place to chill, their coffee was so good too. I ordered coffee mocha (35k) and cheese cake (38k), it's quite pricey (for me) since it's also excluded tax and service, wkwk. But, no worries since they offer you such a taste and great place. Just a little suggestion, maybe you can place the call button in the middle or on scan barcode menu standee, so there's no ""pushed button by accident"" like what happened to me. Cheers!"

Taste of the food is delicious, they have many variations of satay. You can ask to re heat the satay, and they will grill the satay again. It will be great if they re grease the satay with kecap or their own sauce. Rice also very delicious, all of the variant is worth to try. My only complaint is there is not much snack or gorengan, only satay, rice and drink. Price is okay, not on the cheap side, but also not to be considered pricy.

it is Setup as a Traditional Angkringan, But almost everything is leaning towards modern food style, The Kopi Joss still uses Hot Charcoal but the coffee itself they used Instant mix Coffee from a scahet, the choices of food also consist mainly of children's food of choice such as various meatballs, sausage, with alot of MSG and salt for taste.
Don't get me wrong, their food still taste great but I miss the real traditional food that angkringan used to serve in the old days
Lucky the setup of the place still feels authentic, and price wise its still worthy to be called Angkringan.

A very unique experience for slow living in Yogyakarta. Sipping a glass of charcoal infused coffee after dark on a floor mat along the street, can‚Äôt be found in Singapore.
The Kopi o tastes more smooth as the charcoal neutralized the sourness of the coffee powder. I initially thought the red hot charcoals will be super hot, but they cool down pretty soon.
Select the skewers and the uncle will help you to grill them again, his skewers have a nice smoked flavor that I like, that is lacking in typical loklok in jb.
Came on Monday evening crowd is sparse.
Will be back again if I am in Yogyakarta.
Cost 22k

A good place to have coffee with your friends, but a glass of coffee with a hot charcoal inserted into it is nothing special. It just tastes the same compared to a glass of ordinary coffee. But it is the sensation that makes it unique. There are a lot of snacks too in angkringan style. This place is worth to try!

The food is gooood! They have many variants of snack and you can sit for hours without noticing. I tried the Kopi Jos, it's good. I recommend to go here if you want to hang out with friends."

The service is very helpful however the food-making time was so lame. The coffee and tea were nice, but the Creamy Chicken Popcorn tasted a little bit bland.

Nice Establishment!
The ambience was just spot on where you see lots of people enjoying their weekend with books, talks, and chores.

Price is average and well, packaging was very nice for takeaway and coffee just very well made.

Their staffs were very friendly too. This is a good place for a comfort hangout and coffee.

The overall ambience of this coffee was calming ü§ó lots of people came here to work, have discussion, read. Price was normal. The drink we tasted were good (piccolo, coffee with a hint of strawberry, red velvet iced).
There are musholla n toilet available in second floor

Went here for breakfast. Small but neat. Like the coffee, and more importantly like the almond pie! I even bought it for takeaway to bring it home to Bekasi haha. Definitely will go back here next time I'm in Yogya.

nice and comfortable place to work from cafe. the coffee is good, my favorite coffe menu is ‚Äúbruni‚Äù a twist of coffee with chocolate and strawberry syrup. however, the pastry is not so great, even if i asked it to be re-heated, still not so crunchy."

I ordered chocolate milk and the chocolate still tasted great. Their spicy noodle menu is delicious and somehow for me it's not that hot. For the chicken menu, the chicken is tasty but I don't like the chili sauce. Last but not least, the potato with bbq seasoning is a good choice for side dish. A good place for hanging out at night because the view is dope!

Nice place to sit and relax in Batu area with family or friends. It was three-stories resto with mountaneus and driving range view. The food and drink is OK.

Nice place, cozy rooftop, love the drinks. Mostly crowded, so you better pick the right time

For the place is good , nice view , so fresh.
But for food , all i tasted poor seasoning.

Loved the view. I can give any review about food . I only ordered hot chocolate .. and love it"

If you want visit here to get a dinner, that's not good choice.

This place offer a comfortable place to killing time with your friends. Ngobrol ngalor ngidul karo ngombe-ngombe.

The price would be affordable if you get another purpose (hang out, enjoy music jamming, and etc)

Good service, easy to get parking car area although the traffic if you want to here a little bit hetic. up

I didn't get a chance to visit Goeboex last time in YK and finally got a chance to try. The drink is as expected, it meets my standard, and properly priced.

Nice atmosphere, love it to be here !!
I ordered just black coffee no sugar, it was so original black. Really great !! üëçüëçüëç

They do have various kind of delicious desserts, and they taste better with the drinks they serve including the coffee. The place is cute. Unfortunately they have a very limited space for smoking area. Yeah, smoking area doesn‚Äôt the overall concept anyway.

This is a great place to chill The atmosphere is quite comfortable. The place is also unexpectedly spacious. They have indoor and outdoor seating areas. Recommend if you want to relax after touring Jogja and want dessert/sweet

The ice cream itself is quite okay, they have some variety of flavours. We've also tried Apple Pie, Smores Milk Pie, Cinnamon Rolls, Choco Cookie, Red Velvet, Lasagna, Macaron Schotel is the bomb.. nothing fails and all very delicious. We keep ordering again and again üòç

This place is for you if you one of those sweet tooths. Must try the ice cream. Theirs not too sweet, more into ""dairy"" side. Not so much ice cream flavors, but all of them is great. The price is also reasonable.
Interior has aesthetic design, great to just talking with friends but not recommended to work/study bcs it is quite noisy and theres no charging port.

One of the most famous gelato cafes in Yogyakarta.
Milk by Artemy used to be called only Artemy but they did some rebranding and even moved to this location with better concept.
The place is located not on main street, so trust Gmaps to take you here.
You can park your cars or motorcycles on the side of the road.
The place will greet you with the gelato display right on the side of the entry door.
So you can directly pick your gelato before entering the cafe.
They have may range of flavors that you can pick.
It has some baked goods like cakes, pies, buns as well.
The interior is aesthetically pleasing, perfect for those looking for a place to snap some pictures for your social media.
They have smoking area on the side filled with plants to absorbs the smoke, nice!
Definitely don't come here during weekend or holidays since it will be hard to find a place to sit, since people tend to stay longer after they finished their gelato.

Good place for milk-based gelato. Biga scoops with a thin wafer on top. Kinda sweet for my tastes, though.

Chocolate were out by the time we got there, it was around 3 pm.

The room was spacey, but it was too warm with only half of the AC on. There were several outdoor seats as well."

What I like about this place? It opens 24 hours!! You can come at anytime you want. It offers affordable prices for each beverage and food menu item plus it also has combo menus. Good wifi connection, suitable for date, meeting, dling your homeworks or if you just want to meet up with your friends. This is my second time visiting this caf√© and will surely not my last one. If you want to have really quiet moment to do your that requires high concentration or private conversation, I suggest to come early morning.

Two refreshing drinks for only Rp.22.000? You‚Äôve come to the right place.. nice environment, settings and people... best yet not the best, but hey.. you can have a great time hanging out here with friends..

I dont know what's the good thing about this place. It's large, oke, but the food and beverages aren't recommended cuz they're costly & taste 6/10. The toilets are all toooooo small, narrow and dirty!!! The stairs also dirty and dusty. Nowadays you'd better find another place to hang out.

Really cozy, great ambience, a lot of seating provided. Quite cheap with very wide range of foods and beverages. The foods are also tasty! Open up to 3am if I'm not mistaken. They also got offer that if your order hasn't come in 15mins, you'll get it for free."

Lantai bumi has spacious area for both its smoking and non-smoking area. No need to worry for the parking area too. What i love the most from this place is that people come here mostly to work or study, so the ambience here is quiet and peaceful..

I arrived in Jogjakarta so early and needed to find place to get a coffee or breakfast before I can check-in at hotel. I found this cafe. The place is very comfortable. Coffee was good! Waffle was great! My wife‚Äôs specialty tea was excellent!

Wi-Fi was enough for me to do morning meetings.

Recommended for you who wants to get breakfast or good coffee near Jalan Kaliurang.

The ambience of this place is nice. It' good to chill here by yourself or with your friends. The workers here is friendly, they will check your temperature as well. This place has non-smoking and smoking area which are quite big. You can park you motorbike infront of the building, they also provide a parking area for car. The food and beverages itself is tasty.

The place is nice, really comfortable for group discussion, casual hangout, or having proper meal. The place is always packed up with young adults as the place is very close to student residences. However, the coffee price is a bit overpriced. Americano costs 31k and the coffee is so-so. In Jakarta, 31k for Americano is common, we can even get really good coffee for 28k. here in Jogja I expect so-so coffee cost not more than 30k. But overall, I love this place and definitely will come back but not for the black coffees.

Lantai Bumi always be a great place to work from coffeeshop. The ambience, menus, etc.

But not with their interior design, so similar with Starbucks. Let's say it's a local Starbucks. It feels like they don't have their own characteristics. Still better for me, since they have excellent staff and their coffee is superb!

After exploring many coffee shops, I found one coffee shop which I think is really worth it for students like us to visit üòÄ.  Nakoa cafe Bondowoso is one of my favorite hangout cafes, it seems I have visited this cafe countless times.  The reason why Nakoa is my favorite cafe is that most of the people who come here are students doing their assignments, so it makes the atmosphere of the cafe calm and not chaotic.  The people at Nakoa also don't care about visitors, so I think Nakoa is really good for me time.  My favorite menu here is the matcha latte üíö.  Apart from the matcha latte, the drinks here are also delicious.  The price is also standard, which is under 25,000.  Apart from selling drinks, here they also sell some delicious food, moreover, the donuts are really delicious and cheap üòÉ.  For those of you who like to do assignments alone, you can really try this Nakoa cafe.

The place so comfy for works both indoor and outdoor, the coffee is great too. WiFi so fast, the staff so friendly, i have a good experience at Nakoa Cafe, just need some improvement to make the toilet clean. Overall is good, i'll come again to Nakoa Cafe. Waiting for the new menu for filling my tummy.

This is a special place for co-working which makes it also a great coffee shop. Italian espresso machine Simonelli makes nice coffees and you feel like being in a sort of modern museum. Really outstanding design....well done!

I think the doughnut is a normal doughnut. It has no speciality, except the price, 9k ü§≠
The coffe was also tasty as normal coffe.
We can freely take a mineral water.

My only place to go when my car have a problem I believ since 2008. The service and hospitality is very nice. The staff is friendly and informative. They make sure that the old parts can be maintaned before the option goes to full change the parts. The price is proper and they try can done the service by end the service hour as long they not fully occupied. This place offer car paint with oven option so the result will closely to the original one. There is also the car wash and the price is not that pricy. There is also indoor waiting area with full AC.

Note for this place is only the entrance way because during the rainy season especially will have flood. So it is hard to pass by foot when you want to go out.

It is a really unpredictable eating resto. The entrance is a narrow alley, enough for one car, with slump area on both sides. And then we get into a abandoned look steel building. But unfortunately it is the parking area of the resto.
The facade of the resto is not inviting at all. But the delicious smell comes from it, and makes us wanna try. Just right when you come across the lobby, you will be surprise with lovely view. Comfy huts everywhere, outdoor seatings are arranged nicely, some even naturally made from stones and wood. Like it is not enough, it is surrounded by rice field in one side, and small lake at other side. Lovely greens and trees in the area make it more comfy. The view of surrounded rice fields with the skyscrapper building and giant electric tower at the far backgroun, with blue sky and lots of bird flying make the place more pretty.
The live music stage on the lake make it even more enjoyable.
The food it self is very delicious. The black pepper and butter sauce seasoning for the seafood are recommended. The sambal (traditional chili sauce) is very good. And importantly the price is in good range. Love it.

Very nice place for dining with family and friends, many choices on the menu. But better for lunch rather than dinner...cos mosquitos! Hidden quiet place behind a garage

A nice place to spend your weekend with family. You can spend hours here eating, chit chatting with friends and family while children can play at the playground.
Nice view and atmosphere. A great relaxing escape at Surabaya.

really nice place, a hidden gem in busy area. the place is hidden on small alleys but the place itself is spacious. They have a carwash here. The place is semi outdoor and seated on small gazebos. really nice atmosphere, but a bit expensive here."

I think I dont need to explain their various menus of coffee, tea or foods, cause everybody else already did :D.

The branch is everywhere, street side or inside malls in Surabaya area.

Parking area, lately they build additional new indoor area which used for parking. Very convenience.

Quite a great place for any time for a bit meal. You can just sit and enjoy the meal that you prefer.

Food taste is based on your preference.

Great ambiance, spacious, good services,
Lost 2 stars for the food and beverage I had (i only tried the croissant and Thai bubble tea. Which I didn't really enjoy)

Croissant wasn't crispy till its layers. The Tuna filling wasn't promising, tasted dull and isn't moist enough.

Thai bubble tea was too sweet it covered the tea flavor, bubble was okay.

Should I try the other menu, I'll update.

The staffs are friendly and helpful. The food is   good and actually we like the various beverages. The ambience is nice for a chit chat. Non smoking and smoking area are available. Parking without worries since there are parking lot available.

one of my favorite place to work, the working area is very comfortable yet quiet (in the right hour), so we can focus on our work. The foods are good with reasonable price. The smoking area is cozy.

This restaurants have good ambiance for study or meeting. They have various types of coffee and non-caffeine range to choose. The food menu is limited but they have each types of pasta where we can chose pasta preferences based on our likings. Their staffs and waiter are good at their job and they will send our food to the table so you didnt need to pick up.

great place to chill in the afternoon, make your weekend more relax.

The atmosphere is good. We booked a private meeting room on the second floor. It's nice for meeting or co-working space. But maybe you need a bell or something like that to facilitate communication with customers above because there are no staff on standby on the second floor. The food and drinks are quite interesting and a bit pricey but the taste are so-so.

Welp. Typical starbucks. Great coffee, pleasant staff. The atmosphere however is a little below stardard. When you pass by the entrance, the walkway going to the main door needs a little cleaning. It could be a little cleaner. That being said, I ordered cappucino and it was perfect.

[Others]: Definitely recommended for group lunch/dining since they have various menu choices. The only cons is¬†we got 2 different prices menu book (old price & new ones) so we need to be careful. Hopefully the management notice and withdraw the old price menu book.

Clearly one of the best place to eat out with friends and family. The atmosphere is great, spacious place, modern & minimalistic style. The foods and drinks are plentiful to choose, good taste also. Small notes though, the asparagus soup tasted a little bit odd. All is perfect, but will be better if the price can be a little bit lower

Provides many kinds of chinese dishes. the place is comfortable to hang out. The outside place we can enjoy with the view of fields. The dishes is good but there are nothing distinctive taste

A restaurant with a mountain view so you can eat and talk for a long time with friends and even family. You can choose indoor or outdoor. Fast service with quite a number of waitresses.

I was here for late lunch and the weather was amazing, I decided to dine in upstairs with air breeze in Malang.
I've ordered Dahayu Tea and the taste was refreshing, its taste sour and sweet smell, just like berries does.

Hospitality was amazing. I enjoyed the quick order proses with the staff and I did not mind to go downstaird to pick up my order and went back again upstairs.

But the meal, I was so sad I had to feel disappointed with this food, the asparagus chicken.
Chicken was served in a hotplate and I hardly wait to try with sauce.

Chicken was hot.
But the sauce was cold as fff, same with the mini croquet and veggies.

I do not know what was going on that day, but all part of meals should served hot. But not for the sauce, even when I mixed the cold sauce and hot chicken, its meal temperature lowering to room tempie.

Not good.
I really not planning to coming back here."

Literally beyond..

The place is super beyond and comfy
The coffee is also super beyond and great
The food is beyond and tasty

Very friendly staff and very nice food. My sandwich was very nice served and tasted nice. The mochado I ordered was amazing. Quality wise, it is comparable with cafes in Jakarta, this one might be better. Though it is considered expensive in Pekalongan. They have two different areas, indoor and outdoor. They also have plenty seats. It is less than 5 minutes away from Batik Museum.

Such a cozy place to hang out with various options of menu."

I wasn't disappointed at all, in fact it exceeded my expectation! The vibes of the cafe is a great combination of sprawling plants, succulents, recycled junks (to reduce waste), retro, semi outdoor‚Äîall things I love in one package! Every corner is a great place to take pictures of. Also to note, not many drivers are familiar with the place (they all looked puzzled upon seeing the place) as it's hidden in Malang city‚Äînext to a rice field (it's quite chilly there). It's truly one of a kind.
Things I ordered: teh poci, wedang uwuh, nasi goreng jawa bungkus ndog, tahu petis, sego godhog retro-they were really good and affordable! I left the place feeling satisfied.

Love it, because they don't use a single use plastic. the price i think is Cheap in rate 10.000-30.000  The consep  cafe garden, make u feel relax. For take away they can't because they not use single use plastic.

One of the best coziest place to hang out, GREAT food, try the Cireng ayam it‚Äôs delicious, always comeback for it.

Could be a best place to set a meeting with, not too crowded on weekdays, need to come earlier for weekend since it‚Äôs mostly packed.

Retrorika keep it‚Äôs quality of the food since last i came here, good job great work Retrorika team

A cafe with an eco concept, utilizing used goods for furniture, lamps, decorations, pots for plants, and others.

In serving food & drinks, this cafe does not provide straws, tissue and disposable packaging. The menu list is also not printed, (because if will change the menu or the price will print it again) so you just need to go through the barcodes installed on each table.

The atmosphere in here comfortable, in the middle of vegetable & flower fields, perfect for relaxing with friends, colleagues and relatives.

Their service is sufficient, the friendliness of the waiters may need to be improved. Prices for food & drinks at this cafe are still reasonable. So, it's worth it to try and visit here, guys

Best find in Batu! An eccentric retro cafe with eco-friendly concept filled with tons of plants. Very affordable price, most of the menu ranges from 15-25k. Although it's semi-indoor with no AC, but it doesn't feel hot at all even during lunchtime. Instagrammable spots available at every corner."

The place is widely lit with huge sun ceiling bringing a great vibe for those occupied with their study. Socket plug was ample. The place goes long way back with more outdoor seatings. The drinks are alright and the food as well. Price was mediocre. Liked the vibe here and decided to spend half of my day here.

Such a beautiful coffee shop. The interior design is excellent and the menus are exquisite. Some of the sofas are very comfortable. You can either hang out with you friends and family or study in here. It is quite pricey and you have to pay for additional taxes but it's still worth the price. It has a large parking lot, a prayer's room and clean toilets.

This coffee shop is a comfortable place to study for hours. They have outdoor and indoor seats. You can come here alone or with friends.

I bought caramel macchiato and though the coffee not too strong, it was tasty. The mozarella stick was quite good too. They serve coffee, meal and snacks. Price is reasonable, not too pricey but they charge 10% ppn.

They have spacey parking lot for car or motorbike. Musala and toilet are outside the building, not too clean but musala is spacey.

My first time coming here and it's a good place for study, work, or just hangout. The interior theme aligns with the cafe name, Kaktus. There are kaktus in the parking lot and on the tables. Anywhere.

Also there are hanging plants on the indoor ceiling. It gives the serene ambience.

The menu are various with reasonable price. There's also packed ice cream in a display freezer, which is interesting; but I forgot to buy it at the end because I was too tired.

I ordered mix platter and iced salted caramel latte with extra shot of espresso. The food's came in a big portion and variation. The drink's good because it's not too sweet--maybe because of the extra shot.

There are many seating options; outdoor and indoor. Upstairs or downstairs.

The parking is not free, but spacious.

People keep coming in and out; means that this place is famous. It's just me who's not really good in finding good cafes.

A casual spot for hang out with mix of working or even doing your meeting with friends/colleagues.

Large parking area for motorcycle in the back and enough space for cars too.

Good service from their staffs too. Price is okay and taste wise is good. Keep it up yah!"

Food and beverages are all good. If you like savory, their Chicken Pie is good! And if you like savory dish with tomatoes, try Shakshuka (morning only).

One of the best Coffee Shop in town. Coffee tastes great. Not too many fancy option tho. Pastries are many. Food is delicious. Service is great, the workers work fast with good hospitality. Atmosphere is awesome, you can pick to sit on the indoor with AC or outdoor with direct golf view. That's why many people come for meeting, work with their laptop, hangout with friends. You can also drive thru your order. Parking space is for free because it's inside Graha area. Their croissant is delicious, their salad is good.

The only thing that could be improved here is the panacota. Its pricey but not so tasty

Nice service. Since surabaya is near from the sun and really really hot, the outdoor is a no if you come around lunch time. The matcha croissant is so lovely, the sweetness is just perfect. Matcha is on point. Bathroom cleanliness is excelllent.

A nice comfy cafe with lots of sofa to have a good time with friends and variety of delicious food to choose from!

The food are good.  Lil bit overprice. There are 2 different variant of menu .. traditional and also western.beer, coffe, steak, salad etc. Tasty but my Poutin is too much salt and pepper. Great peeformance so far.

Honestly this place has a very nice building and interiors are very nice. But the service itself is not even decent. I ordered asem asem bola daging, the food looks very nice and i was really craving for this, but one thing was that i couldn‚Äôt eat spicy food for today for particular reason. When i ordered the food, ive asked the waiter TWICE wether the food was spicy or not, and the waiter has confirmed, that it‚Äôs not spicy, yes he confirmed it twice and i heard it very clearly about every single word that he said that the food ISNT SPICY, i believed it and gave it a chance. I have placed all my hopes for this food but when the food came, it came with tons of chili, it wasn‚Äôt even 5 or 10, it was more than 10. I tried to separate the chili from the soup but it didn‚Äôt do anything, this made me very dissatisfied. When the waiter had said that this asem asem wasn‚Äôt spicy AT ALL, and turns out it was very VERY spicy. The steak was also raw, and the sauce taste was normal, i wont even say its worth for my money. This restaurant is disappointing."

It gets to be quite crowded. However the staff is extremely well trained and friendly. They‚Äôre polite and go the extra mile to make sure you have a great experience. We didn‚Äôt get food while we were there but the display case was nicely kept and full of diverse options.

Nice restaurant within an upscale neighbourhood in Malang.

Foods and drinks are great and delicious.

The ambiance is amazing and it is pretty busy and popular among young people.

Wifi is available even though it's not that good. Maybe because it is prerty crowded even during weekdays.

There's plenty of seats and tables here, indoor and 2 floor, and some outdoor seating. Good variety of menu, and with fair price to considering the place. Free wifi, great service. Their food and drink tastes good too. Parking space is big for car and bike, you pay the fee on the entrance via langsep. There's also a paid photobox here.

This cafe, which is located on Jalan Dieng, is a comfortable place to just do your assignments or hang out with friends and family. The menu itself is quite varied and quite unique. Apart from coffee, milk and tea, there are also snacks such as french fries, potato wedges, chicken yakitori, takoyaki, onion rings. For heavy food is also quite varied. Food prices at Robbuca range from Rp. 18,000 ‚Äì Rp. 35,000 rupiahs. Meanwhile, drinks range from Rp. 8,000 ‚Äì Rp. 23,000 rupiahs. Inside the Cafe there is also a photo booth at a price of Rp. 35,000 can already take funny photos. The advantages of this place are that the cashier who serves is quite friendly and the place is quite spacious. The drawback is that there are few employees so no one cleans the table so if visitors come there are still food leftovers from previous visitors

Nice place. Already Several times come here, but today hardly say i found bit curly hair inside our delicious edamame."

A lot of milk choices and other beverages
They have kids menu too
Children happy playing in the playground

The minus thing is, it was took so long when we ordered for the second
Maybe waiters should have more coordination each others

Seems like a good option for family. The only good thing is they have a playground for children. However, a lot of review here already mentioned that the service is faaaaar away from adequate.
The employee have bad coordination, it took too long for our orders, orders from later customers even come before ours.
Total wait time 90 minutes (mostly food, the drink are fast, Ice cream can take to an hour as well)
Food choice is limited for a kid friendly restaurant.
Some tables are not ergonomic and you can‚Äôt move it at all.
Wi-Fi is available, however I have yet to test it.
Prayer room available.

doesn‚Äôt have adequate and proper parking lots, and interferes with environmental roads, poor service, there are still many shortcomings, there is no readiness at all, the service is lacking even though it has moved many places and many branches have closed.

The food was good and Thai tea and strawberry milk was so delicious! The place is quite spacious. The light is a bit dark for me. But good for enjoying the vibes of Solo city!

This is the new place, they moved
The milk still good
The place is better
They don't serve my usual menu anymore =(  , the food i order still good tho"

A cool place to spend your day and night. Friendly and professional services, great staff! They have a pool and open area for music, also DJ performance.

Minimum spent is 250k per person. You can also rent a sofa bed near the pool with minimum spent 1500k per bed. VIP area is also available with private mini pool, rent for 10.000k per room. They also have very huge parking area for free.

Great vibe, too bad didn‚Äôt get to check out during the day or sunset. Even at night I still enjoyed it. Food was great, not that expensive given the quality. Staffs are very friendly and attentive. Music is great the day i visited. Many types of seating looking good.

Great place to hang out and see the sunset.

If you want to sit at the outdoor, buy the voucher 150k per adult which can be exchanged with food and beverages. There are minimum order also for poolside sofa. If you want to have a heavy meal, go straight to the restaurant, no need to buy voucher but the menu is different with the one at the outside.

Top notch views and service! The food was okay considering the price, but the ambiance and the staffs make up for it. I was there June 2022 and they require us to purchase voucher that can be exchanged for food. It was weekday afternoon and the place was sparsely crowded so we enjoyed some quiet lunch."

There is no doubt about the food. They are worth every penny. The taste are amazing with good portion you won't regret.

The place is clean, refreshing, super comfortable and recomended to those who love to just sit and do some stuff, hang out or even have a date there.

Been here for several times. The place is comfortable enough though it gets really crowded at times. The food and drinks are really worth the price. Loved the food here, as well as the beverages! The ambiance is great, the service is also great. One of my favorite cafes in town, and definitely one of the best ü•≥

I love the cafe ambiance, cozy and beautifully set. There are indoor with cozy couch and dining table also outdoor for smoking area. The food and drinks menus are vary, lots of choices whether you want to have big meal or just simply snacking. Unfortunately they don't serve hot cappucino or latte, it's only warm. Also the choco lava cake is hard, the chocolate doesn't melt when you cut it.

Come from Surabaya to Sidoarjo on weekend to try food and beverages in this cafe. The ambiance was good, there were many seats available there. For foods and beverages are a variety. I bought croissants, iced matcha latte, and spaghetti black pepper.
If I may give a suggestion for a croissant, it is better to ask the customer first whether to warm it or not. Because I bought a croissant usually served crispy, but yesterday maybe because the chocolate melted when reheated so it reduced the texture of the croissant

Plus : nice vibes, lot of space (indoor & outdoor), delicous beverage & meals, reasoanble price.
Minus : n/a yet

Been here countless time already and never been disappointed. The latte was not bad, it was well-balanced with a rather acidic note in every sip. The texture was creamy and smooth as well. Fried rice was okay. The scrambled eggs in the All Time Breakfast could be runnier but the potatoes were nicely seasoned. Another visit? Definitely yes.

It is another restaurant recommended by my Surabaya friend.üòä

Atmosphere ok strategic lovation but sometimes too noisy due to semi open air and the traffic but the menu, taste and variety are good

A great place to hang out with friends and family! Food and beverages vary, the price range from 20-50 thousand rupiah. At that time I ate fish and chips and green tea, it tastes good and quite filling. Because it is located at a crossroads, so the view is pretty good. There was live music too until about 11pm, and it was very entertaining.

The place is nice, cozy, and clean. The menus are affordable and taste really good, although it may take some time (30-45 minutes) per menu to be served. It's a good place for having online work/class, or even family gatherings

Nice place to havr a dinner..they offer some kind of traditional food and drinks.. i ordered Jahe kencur gula merah, alang2 tea with rosella, rawon blonceng and noodle. Im so happy to find they serve the drinks with the real herbs fulfilling the glass..looks so authentic and traditional..i like the alang2tea with rosella at the most, the scent and taste is so refreshing and healty feels..
Rawon is okay but the noodle taste better. I think i will come back to try another food"

Refreshment drinks, a variety of milk beverages, either with ginger, spice-herbals, honey and/or egg yolks. Since 1974, it started as a family business and remains until now, in a narrow alley of Malang urban dwelling.

Racikan STMJ nya pas di lidah.. bikin nyaman di badan..
Ada gorengan, kerupuk, keripik dan roti bakar jg sbg side dish :)

Bisa buat nongkrong..

A must try

perfectly how to mix and brew from starting with boiling milk mixed with eggs, honey and ginger stirred evenly with care so that it produces best rich and  soft taste without a fishy smell of egg.

serving since 1974 they told, what makes this place is special because they pour honey so generous to your glass. So the taste is quite a bit too sweet for me and my brothers. I also try their TMJ jaddam, more spicy than their STMJ. This place doesnt have a proper car parking, so if you bring car to this place, you will park in front of some house near STMJ pak sentot"

They have many coffee menus, and if you are not so into coffee, you can still reserve a mild coffee menu like hazelnut, caramel, mocha, etc. They serve noncoffee too.
There are so many tables on three floors. If you are a smoker, don't too worry, they have a smoking room area on the 3rd floor and in front of the entrance. For people who need to work on a laptop for a long time, you can find charging outlets on every corner. Placed in a strategic area, it is a complete coffee shop!

Love the ambience. If you wanna stay long and do some work with a nice cup of coffee, then this is the place. I came to this place a few times and totally gonna come back again. The coffee is üòã yums. Love it. And really glad for all the staff who works there, they were really friendly and when they tried their best to explain to me about the various coffee choices in English. Would definitely come back!

The place looks small but there are actually 3 storeys, and only the third storey is allowed for smoking. They have good choices of drinks and good wifi, pretty suitable for working. It's just the chairs are not so comfortable if you work there long enough. Drinks are quite pricey (30k+).

I came to use the co-working space at 9 am in the morning and meet a friend. They didn't serve Indonesian breakfast (that is a full meal with rice) but they do have selections of pastries and cakes to lightly stuff your stomach. I ordered Kopi Subuh (orange juice, tonic water, espresso) and earl grey banana cake. The caf√© have 3 stories: the first one is the lobby where the coffee machine, the second one is an air conditioned room, and the third one is a smoking room. I stayed in the second stories until lunch o'clock. It has the view of Slamet Riyadi street, air conditioning, and a very loud music. It will be better if they could lower the music down. I mean, it's heard to talk with your colleague when you have your noise-cancelling earphone on üòÖ

I rarely got attached to a coffee shop but this one is an exception. The coffee was nice with plenty of variation. The cake in the showcase are preheated before it got served. They also got internet wifi with high speed.

Everything checks if you're looking for a coffee shop that you'd like to spend hours therein."

The waitress is fast in responding the food order and serving the plate. However, during the raining season i found out the smoke of grill activity quite annoying inside the main room.

The place is hidden in a small road and unexpected üòä I found it by chance but it was actually a nice surprise. I like the setting especially the veranda outside. A free setting makes the place look bigger and relaxing atmosphere is obvious here.
The drinks are good and the sushi is ok.
Lots of parking place for motorcycles but the cars have  to park on the side road next to it. Worth a try üòäüòä

Affordable good food with big portions, better sit outside under the shade because the indoor building is too hot even if all aircons were turned on. The service from the waiter/waitress was good, but not for the cashier. The cashier lady was unfriendly and not very welcoming towards me & my friends, she handled our order lazily like she didn't want to be there.

Love the ambiance. It's located in a quiet neighbourhood. Vast parking area. Very bright, the place will put you in a good mood once your glance at it. Really love the outdoor area. Best time to come here I think is around 3-5p.m. Coupled with Malang fresh air. Definitely a place for a fun gathering with friends. Food was alright. We ordered School Dosirak and Jjajangmyeon, with Itaewon (ReVe drink) and Hongdae (milk w/ salted caramel). Itaewon drink could be better. Hongdae was tasty. The staffs were very friendly and helpful.

Love the atmosphere here. For those who want to feel the Korean vibe and who like K-Pop, it's really suitable here. The parking lot is quite wide and next to Sejenak Coffee.
The interior design looks simple from the outside, as soon as you enter, you immediately feel the Korean vibes because of the Korean decorations and music being played. Aesthetic in every corner.
There are quite a lot of indoor and outdoor places. In the indoor area, there is a really good photobox. In the outdoor area there is a pojangmacha selling street food.
The menu options vary, from snacks to heavy meals. There is a grill package menu, ramyeon and other menus such as mandu, kimbab and many more. For drinks, there are quite a few choices. There is also a showcase filled with bottled and canned drinks. Prices range is 23 thousand - 55 thousand rupiahs. Suitable for lunch or dinner. Or hanging out, snacking, and enjoying the vibes is also okay. If you're expecting food in k-drama, you'll find it here.

Overall it's a good place and good eats."

Its okay cozy and good food more than price. Recomended

great coffee, they have in-house roastery, and you could buy roasted coffee beans there, and ask them to grind it if you didn't have grinder at home. the only minus for me, is the mushola looks so dirty, and hidden in the 2nd floor, and didn't really well kept & clean

but I do highly recommend the smoking / non-smoking room, for a casual or business meeting. I usually visit Labore after 19.00, their night vibe is also lovely.

Great place to hang out. All menus that we tried was delicious. Not much space in the non-smoking area.

Very comfortable cafe that serves good quality of tea, coffee, snacks and main courses. Indoor and outdoor seatings are available. Smoking and non-smoking seats are for your choices.

Most of the foods and beverages in the menu suits my tastebud really well. It provides various baked rice and baked pasta as their top main food, various side dishes, various coffee and non coffee. It‚Äôs quiet crowd so sometimes you should be on waiting list to eat here. My top menu are (baked) Nasi/Pasta Japanese Chicken Curry, and (baked) Cheese Bayam. The staffs are friendly and nice. For me who is not living in Malang; I always longing for this place and foods.

If you hunger for pasta and some fusion food try lailai cafe, the serve many kind and varieties  food from pasta, burger, and indonesian fusion  that taste really good. The drinks also  good with their variation and huge portion

The place is quite small. But the food is sooo good and delicious. A lot of pasta type of food. Drinks are also good.
If u go there u need to inform the waitress how many people u come with, and they wil write ur name in the waiting list. U have to wait until they call ur name

The food was good. I love the strawberry tripple. The staffs were friendly. Definitely will come back later to try another menu.!!

Java Dancer located in a quiet residential area. It is small enough to seat about 15 people, and the interior is as cute as its pretty name. Even though it is early for dinner, there are 7-8 locals seated. Ordered a salad and chicken for coffee and a light meal. Quantity is more than expected. Delicious coffee and food. But Salad is so salty.

After a hot day wandering lost and stressed around Malang, this was such a relaxing place to cool off. We felt so happy and relaxed in this beautiful shop, surrounded by plants and the sound of bubbling water.

They have single origin coffees from around Indonesia, which can be brewed in five different ways. This was fun to tour. We tried the Kintamani brewed in a siphon, which was mild, with a mango juice they prepared with 100% mango and cream. So refreshing! It's a little expensive as they have some extra charges for certain taxes, which was explained in the menu. Just don't be surprised by the bill.

The ambiance is the strongest point, along with a great menu of drinks and food.

Cosy open air caf√© with extensive menu for both international and local food! We came here for the espressos and they really hit the spot! We indulged on an affogato and ginger latte as well as some delicious pancakes and roti bantal with chocolate!

Wonderful decor and experience for a foreigner like me to see the batik, masks and other traditional puppets. We went between meals but The food looked amazing and I would love to go back and try it.

Got there for just take some coffee..
Ordered hot cappuccino with extra shoot..They used their specialty house blend coffee..

Great for outdoor quick photoshoot.
There was an outdoor picnic set up for groups, interesting.

I only go there once, and i think i will think twice to go there again. I appreciate their concept of making a cafe with a nice scenery in the evening. They have some chairs and tables in the yard. So you can have chit chat either with your friends or your boyfriend/girlfriend. I like one of the menu, banana nugget. However, the serious point is that i think the menu are overprice for some ppl like me. Also, they dont offer various menu to be selected.

Cant take a proper picture yet rest assured it was a nice place to hang out. However, i hope that there are more food options in the menu.

Great place to hangout with friends and family. A lil bit cold at night because it's semi outdoor place, don't forget to bring your jacket or warm suit. Super cozy atmosphere!

Good place to chill and spend time with companies or by yourself.
All drinks and snacks are highly recomended with pocket friendly price.

Quite famous place, quick fast food good for night snack. Has many lesehan area for hangouts. So many ketan variation. The one with brown sugar kind of tastes of pecel, which is so unique.

The place is normal. Only name wins. The taste is also ordinary. The one in Batu Square has never been tried because it is too crowded, the place is narrow and the queue is long. After I tried, I prefer the angsle in front of the Malang temple hahahha. The price is quite expensive for a very small plate size. The STMJ also tastes normal and has a little taste of raw milk.

I really like this food! Ordered with chocolate and cheese variant and the taste is really good. Combined with ginger milk and all is perfect ! I planned to visit the store in city plaza in Batu but the queue was so long.

The only decent food is the ketan. They give the durian topping as a whole durian (two pieces tho). The teh tarik was awful. The mochaccino was bad. The service was fine. The place was too crowded. I'm sorry but it's too disappointing to be called as ""ketan legenda"""

If you visit this place, make sure not come in lunch time cz that was their time to break. If you come in lunch time then you can't order any dish which have to be cooked.
And the most important thing is the dish right here was tasteless (in my opinion). Even the drink was so bad.
I think the ingredients that they use was expired or bad quality. But anyway, this place was Instagramable. You can take pictures instead eat.

As their name implies, the waffle is their best menu here, it's really good with a lot of choices for toppings. another menu i like are their cheese fried rice and platter (it's good but maybe they can reduce the onion rings and replace them with something else for more balanced variety). For their spaghetti, I recommend their bolognese spaghetti, didn't really like the other spaghetti especially their curry one because i think the taste just doesn't mix well. The atmosphere is quite nice, but I prefer the indoor space because there are lots of mosquitoes in the outdoor space. usually it's full with highschool students from nearby school so it can be quite noisy too

Be Cafe is one of the youth resto place at Surabaya. This place is near from surabaya‚Äôs best school such as smala and spensa. Various menu of drinks and beverages is served here so you can enjoy after-school with your colleagues or waiting for turtoring session. The prize of food at this place is high enough for student but fair for worker. Sadly this place is closed at 22.30 or not 24 hours service. You also need to prepare park retribution here. This place has outdoor and indoor so if you want to stay safe from smoker you can choose indoor one. The service at this place is fast enough so you dont need to wait so long to enjoy your foods. I recommend this place to students for enjoy their weekend after school and also for worker want to meet their friends if not until midnight.

Known for their waffle, they definitely don‚Äôt let you down. Their waffle tastes good and affordable.
The place itself is spacious with lots of tables. They lend board games and stuff for entertaining. They also have projector and screen which usually playing sport games.
The downsides are their staff isn‚Äôt that friendly. The floor sometimes are dirty. And from what I heard, the toilet is dirty as well.
Since I‚Äôve known the place (which recently) I‚Äôve been back like 5 times already. Exploring their other menu and back for the waffle.
Recommended for students and big group (teenagers).

Good place, lots of choices, they have snack main course, and dessert. we eat waffle and croisant. you can choose your favourite topping and ice cream. the price is inexpensive. they have outdoor area and indoor (with aircon). a good place to hang out, doing homework, or just eat.

Few years ago, if im not mistaken,
when i came to this place, it still named by 'be waffles', but yesterday, when i came there, it become 'Be Cafe', hehe

The ultimate feature of this cafe is the ambience. Industrial style interior with chilling jazz/lounge background music creates cozy mood. You can talk, read, day dreaming with this setting.

Apparently the food is made with good ingredients; resulting good presentation. But the taste is so-so compared to the price.

The place is strategically positioned with easy access to main street. You can have a meeting in central Surabaya. Be advised that the main street usually jammed due to rush hour around 5 to 6 pm.

The place is very comfortable. Will definitely come back to hang out and drink coffee but maybe not for a meal.

Just a few minutes away from our hotel, we found this perfect breakfast joint to kick off our day.

Service was impeccable. Both our meals were fresh and delicious! Definitely need to check them out again on our next visit!

I highly recommend this place. Food was delicious, far above our expectations. Fresh, tasty, good presentation. Arrived after 4pm and the promo was a fantastic saving. Great, professional service. Place is exceptionally clean and we loved the extra touch of lemongrass fragrance added to the well maintained restroom. Well done!

When you find that perfect spot and keep going back! Menu isn't huge so you know the food is going to be fresh, well made and absolutely delicious. Even better is getting a great coffee(just like being in Melbourne‚òï
Even though they don't do delivery, we could order and have the Villa pick it up for us. Fantastic!! Special thanks to one of the newer staff, Nata, who is so helpful and welcoming.

This place! Started off with a popular gin drink.
The flavor was great the presentation and over the top.
I had the bowl. Every bite was flavor orgasm, no joke.
If you are into high quality food and ingredients this is your place.
My boyfriend had the Korean chicken sandwich ü•™.
All the flavors worked so well together.
You can tell a lot of time has gone into the menu/recipes.
We took a carrot cake home. The frosting was to die for and the cake was MOIST.
Service was prompt and calculated.
Definitely go!
Also, the space is beautiful.
Actually, we went back.
I had the same bowl (cause I couldn't stop thinking about it) just as amazing the second time! And my boyfriend had the cashew chicken salad. Was also to die for.

Good place and ambience. Food is ok, but menu list dominated by beverage.
Recommended for short escape. Offers camping ground and other mini adventure since it is located on highland.

Good place for camping. The kedai offer good food as well. Toilet is quite clean.

The downside is its so noisy on weekends. First, there was a music event so loud until 22.30. Then the campers are so noisy until 01.00 am. On 3 am the nearby mosque also very loud. Its a bit hard to sleep because of the noise.

Such a nice place to take a rest with a cup of coffee for a while with family. The atmosfer is vintage javanese in the middle of freshness of forest of pine. Live music will acompany you while enjoying drinks and meal...very nice

The cold Agregat coffee drink is good üëç
While the hit cappuccino drink is also perfectly mixed.

Well done team.

Street/gang lead to it are very challenging.
But paid by spectacular views.
Food can be improved. The burger bun is to thin at the bottom so it gets soggy from the sauces etc.
Waitresses  who seat incoming customers are sometimes friendly, sometimes not, depending on who seats who.
But servers were great & efficient.

on weekend: so full, get ready to be on waiting list.
on weekdays: quiet like you own the place.

food: not superb, but it's more than enough to match the atmosphere. Just set your expectation right.

serving time: surprisingly they are still able to serve relatively fast even on weekend with full table

The place offers spectacular view of the downtown, but the path leading to this place is very steep tho. Price is quite affordable: snack, coffee and other beverages are in the range of 20-35k, and the taste isnt that bad. The interior is so on point.

This cafe has the most beautiful scenery of all cafes in batu. Food tasted good. Price is affordable. Great concept and design. The downside would be, the road to this cafe is way too steep. Make sure your vehicles in good condition."

Recommended!

What a nice quiet space. I came in the afternoon and it was quiet. Nice to chill & enjoy some drinks / just read a book.
I didn't get to try the coffee because I've had too much for the day. Instead I had the peanut deconstructed pie. It was ok. I see in other people's review that there were different kinds of dessert which wasn't available when I was there. I assume they rotate their dessert menu.
It's a win for the space for me, will definitely go back to try the coffee.

One of the best coffeeshops I have ever been to. Always recommended to my friend

Although the price is quite expensive. The coffee is always on the right taste and also has an ice cream menu now. Two of my favorite drinks combine into one place.

The vibe is also nice to those who like quieter place to work or study. Even Though the chair is a bit small.

Also have a smoking area separate from non-smoking areas.

Recommendation drink: Hazelnut latte and latte float

Small place but good vibes, 24/7 operation, a little pricy, easy to access the coffeshop, dirty toilet. Smoking area at 2nd floor.

Four stars for the coziness and calmness of the place, very suitable for working or studying. The manual brew coffee is good, they also have many variants of beans. The drinks are pricey for Jogja standard, we spent 33k for the coffee and 33k for the sweet corn tea."

Grabbed dinner here, as it is walking distance from where we stayed.
Had the steak and the nasi rendang. The place seemed to be popular for families with greek-italian sort of vibes. Service was alright. Food was okay. It had live music when we were there.

First of all, the experience and ambience were unique. I mean the interior, accessories, even air conditioning were matching its general theme of Mediterranean, cmiiw. The food was okay, I tried its seafood noodle and I think that's not quite what I expected, sorry. But I do love the coconut coffee. I might try again later for the signature meals.

The staffs were also very humble & kind, they were willing to share many details about taking care of dogs, dogs breeds, etc. I definitely will back here!

A place where you can play with 12 dogs (big and small size dogs). The dogs are all cute and easy to play with. The food was decent but takes very long to come out. The staff was very helpful. You can take pictures with the dogs and the staff will gladly help out. Will definitely come again.

Brilliant place actually !!

Dog was friendly, and the food is nice.

Probably the most impressive thing this cafe can offer is the ambience of the surrounding. Very vibrant as many random people are wandering. The coffee itself is good, but not great. Price wise is affordable, pretty much similar to other similar cafe types. Come here with 3 to 4 friends and enjoy coffee time.

the place is comfortable, there is also a prayer room, so there is no need to bother looking for another place to pray.

I love this place. A really cheap coffee with killer taste! Taste and smell it, but the most important thing was having a conversation with random people was great. Unfortunately, if you are an anti-smoke person, don't visit this place, too many smoke of cigarettes but it is good for social interraction!

Food quality, coffee, price and service are ok. But the ambience of the place...
And the hygiene of the restroom... And the big empty building next to the restaurant...
And the parking space which looks abandoned and full of dried leaves...

If only the owner mind to make this place look more proper....

The place is awesome to hangout with friends and family. But the food taste is so average. I sit in the AC room but still so hot. The staff hospitality average too.

Here is my experience here. The waitress gave me the menu, i was waiting for another friends, so she said to call her when i'm ready. Look at the menu and tried to order, call her, she didn't response. I approached the bar to order, and mentioned my orders. But she asked me to go back to my seat cause she's still going to bring some food to other table. I had to pee, but I had to wait just to repeat my order. Oh and after I order, i tried to took picture from slr camera and they approached me and informed us that they require you to buy Rp 750k for taking pictures using SLR camera.
This whole place and only 1 server taking order and delivering food while the male server only come to tell us not to take photos, pizza came but no plate no fork, we had to ask for them and the servers weren't smiling either....I think with the price you guys should afford better service. There are better and friendlier cafes.
Update: finally some other servers came. I don't where they were but suddenly there are 4 or 5 more. I came @2pm and the servers spurges after 3.
So for me:
Food was: 5 stars
Interior: 3 stars
Service: 1 star

The food presentation is also very nice.

The interior is vintage. There is a collection of motorcycles in front of the main entrance. It‚Äôs nice to see if you‚Äôre into bikers. But, I think it took up too much space. The outdoor area has only 2 sets of tables. We chose outdoor because the non-smoking area is not available.

It was our first time and we got a pouch of signature coffee powder for free because we spent more than 250k.
Thank you, Vosco Coffee!

A very comfortable place to just relax or hanging out with bunch of friends accompanied by a delicious cup of coffee. Coffee is good. Food just too pricey. This place differentiates rooms between smokers and non-smokers, this place also provides an IQOS corner.

A comfortable and good place to have a chit chat with your friends in Malang, the coffee and other beverages and also the desserts are all delicious with reasonable price. Though the parking space is not large but overall it's a nice modern coffee shop in town. Inside you may take pictures in interesting spots that have motocycles on display.

Vosco coffee is amazing! The staff. is friendly, the coffee is really good. They have their own coffee bean products. Ambience is nice and cozy, the dish is quite delicious, they have single origin coffee and brewed by the professionals. It's really recommended for coffee lover when visit Malang city.

I ordered mie goreng and tea., the tea taste really good. Mie goreng was abit salty., next time should try the coffee. I went there before christmas, they put nice christmas ornaments

The atmosphere there is good.
But the food there is not really satisfying. Honey chicken was either over-fried or fried again and the taste is very ordinary. Not going to pay a cafe price for that kind of food quality.
There heritage noodles also taste just like mie goreng from any other street food stores. Sorry to say, taste and potion are better in those food stores.
So, not very recommend to eat there.
However, the coffee is ok.

If you're a morning person, this place may suit your appetite looking for new ideas. It has an Instagrammable view at every corner. There are variety of coffee and food menu when you're looking forward of a big breakfast. The price is in middle range. It's not too expensive nor too cheap as well.

Noi Coffee is the newest hangout spot with mountain nuances located in Cangar, Batu City. For those of you who are looking for a contemporary hangout with natural nuances and lots of photo spots, try visiting Noi Cafe Cangar. guaranteed you will be immediately amazed by the views that are on offer. besides the price of the food and drink menu which is very affordable, the taste is also delicious so it is perfect for those of you who want a thin relaxing vacation.
This cafe itself just started operating in September 2020 and immediately went viral on social media, of course you can already guess why this cafe is quickly becoming famous because in this place the view feels like above the clouds combined with the contemporary cafe design. The atmosphere in this place is very comfortable and away from the hustle and bustle of the city and the weather is cold enough typical of the mountains so that enjoying a cup of hot coffee will feel even more delicious.

Pros:
- nice place to enjoy coffee with mountain views
- nice atmosphere, they have plenty of beautiful plants and flowers.
- relatively cheap compared to what we get.

Cons:
- car park is organized by locals, and they cost us 5 times more than normal parking cost in malang area. That, and we don't get adequate parking spot. NOI management stated that they're building their own parking space, hopefully they'll finish it soon.
- they play old 90s disco at their place. Not the best playlist for cozy coffee place.
- plenty of flies. This is natural and seasonal and the Management can't do anything about it. Choose indoor area if you wanna avoid flies.

I got there late and it was cold. So i ordered kopi Tubruk Arabica and soto ayam. It was a great choice."

Black tea is recommended to be ordered! Moreover for a person who can't drink coffee, like me.

the budae jjigae and jjampong are 5 stars, really good and worth the price! jjampong soup was refreshingüëåüèº the bibimbap was so-so. my friend tried tteokbokki and rappoki, both the sauce and the tteok weren't goodüò¨

We were trapped in Malang‚Äôs traffic jam and decided to stop at Aventree to have a cup of coffee. The restaurant was cute and neat.

When we saw that the restaurant also served Korean Barbecue, we ordered the family package barbecue  and its couple package shabu. The food presentation and taste were barely average.

The Vienesse Coffee was good.

The cafe is upstairs, so you get a great view down into the street. We sat out on the balcony. The staff were so friendly and the menu had a lot of variety. We had vegan burgers and I wish it wasn‚Äôt our last day so we could‚Äôve tried more of the menu. Something for next trip!

A beautiful little place, situated just before you get into the carnage of Ubud centre!  We had a really pleasant stop here for drinks.  There were people with laptops working and others enjoying tapas style foods, small plates, cocktails and coffee.  It was a bit warm, but really nice, with a buzz of conversations and people working.  We had cocktails and I would recommend them!  The service was fast and friendly.  And the balcony area was a great place for drinks and people watching.

Tapas(3 selections) shock us when it came to us. Typically a meal for both of us. Great coffee and smell good, and they sell coffee beans too(230K/pack).
My wife loves their juice.
Only downside is if you don't take onions garlic, there still taste of onion in our side salad, maybe due to the knife etc.
Overall, really a recommended cafe to visit for us vegetarians. High quality food, cafe price.

Nice place for vegetarians. Cocktails were buy one get one which is great, but mostly syrup and not much else. Great atmosphere, and lovely staff (they weren't sure what food was vegan). Food was bland and for a vegetarian restaurant very few vegan options (which is odd).

This cafe is a thing of beauty. From raw aesthetics to the food & service, everything goes just so well together.

I strongly recommend trying their tapas menu, Melting Pot being my favorite of them.

They also have an excellent selection of coffees & cocktails.

And it's very reasonably priced.

Don't come here to work though, the internet isn't good."

It has smoking and non-smoking area. It‚Äôs neat and cozy, that kind of place you could spend your time for chit-chatting or doing your work/thesis. It provides most of western foods and some of asian‚Äôs. It also serve snacks, pastries and bakeries for you to munch around. The staffs are good and helpful, the toilet is clean, and the prayer‚Äôs room is neat and clean (it provides a very fragrant prayer‚Äôs mat and prayer‚Äôs set).

My favorite beverage from this cafe is Milkshake. I didn't find a matcha milkshake for this cafe. When I was a college student, this cafe was always crowded but cozy and quiet.

I recommended Work From Cafe in this place. This cafe must maintain the furniture and interior, but for the taste always be lovely, for waitpersons must smile and be friendly to the customer. BTW, this cafe must pay attention to the plating.

Nice and cozy place and they have smoking (outdoor) and non-smoking (indoor) areas separated. Free Wi-fi and power outlets are available. I think the number of the tables is a little bit small, not surprising because the place is not big. Nevertheless, with the right and nice interiors and light, it feels spacious enough. They apply the new normal protocol so we found that some tables are not in used. I think the chair could be imrpoved, though. I certainly like it if it more comfortable, especially if I want to do my work in the place.
We tried the apple pie, which is part of the pastries displayed at the front counter. It was scrumptious, with the perfect crispy, flaky dough and the right sweetness and sourness of the apple filling. The caesar salad comes as a combination of lettuces, generous amount of grilled chicken, and a slice of garlic bread but with different dressing than the usual yellow caesar dressing I used to know. It uses some kind of mayonnaise combined with certain herbs and spices I think? Kinda tasted the parsley in the dressing somehow. It tasted nice and fresh.
The salted spicy tofu is good, although I prefer mine to be a little bit more salty. It comes with a separate sauce made of sweet soy sauce and chili flakes. The vegetables cream soup tasted good but the texture is somehow quite thick, reminds me of a very thick porridge instead of soup. They're certainly generous with the amount of the vegetables, however.
The chocolate+milk is quite nice, while the iced lemon tea is proved to be a hit for me (definitely want to order it again!). We're lucky enough to get a free ice cream waffle with minimum 100K rupiahs purchase (choose between chocolate, strawberry, or banana one). The strawberry waffle comes with strawberry ice cream, strawberry slices, strawberry jam, and whipped cream that I found very rare used in the waffle sold here in the city. The offer will last until the end of August, by the way.

This place is cozy and classy. You can see yellowish color across the room, so it makes you hungry as soon as you enter the room and almost don't wanna leave it :)) but, if you want to sit comfortably, you may come at afternoon or evening here since this place is too crowded at night. Don't worry about the food and beverages quality, 5 stars are for all menu. Standing applause!

Matcha, Big French Stick, Caramel Macchiato. Cozy and unforgettable place."

They have various menus available to accommodate visitors taste. They also have varried beverage menu, from tea, coffee, juices, and beer.

I beleive this place is popular during the night, with mostly trendy crowds. Perfect for hangout with friends in small group.

I love live music in there, good band.
Outside chair, nice place for group, romantis for couple.
A lot of kind of menu, you can chooise for your favorite.

Have a live music.
Good for just chit chat with firends.
But the price is not worth with the food.
And another thing is, the google map direct wrong coordinate for this place. Better some one fixed it.

Relaxed place with good options for coffee, juice and food. Cozy interior. I wish I was there for live music.

Good foods, beverages and price. Menus are made specially for students. I think, the Warkop Brewok 2. I give 4 stars review for Warkop Brewok 1, cause of the food and beverage, not the place. Especially because of they serve delicious coffee beer Kapiten.

Local coffeeshop with their specialty: kue Pancong, a thick pancake like desert originally from West Java. Usually crowded.

This place is my favorite place to set a meeting with my team, they had a special room at 2nd floor

Good experience for hang out with friends. Place is good, indoor and outdoor with Woody table. These menus are great. But the parking lot is too close with the out door Seat"

Only had drinks & snacks here, so have no idea of food taste.

Coming here because of the name. I thought this place serve traditional Malang cuisines,  unfortunately most of the main courses are western (pizza, steak, sandwich, etc).

Because we're hungry, we continue ordering with minimum expectation. The price are reasonable (most expensive menu is steak and its only IDR 100K).

Food verdict: food taste are excellent, we order almost everything. Pizza, submarine, spaghetti, grill dory, all of it great. Except for steak. It said Japan wagyu, but the meat is very tough, i've order it medium, it should be tender. So the most expensive menu is a big no no üòë

All and all, this place offer great food, but i think it should offer more indonesian menu, so its align with the name of the place.

Their food and latte is really good, even their price is lil bit expensive, i think its worth. Their food price range from 15k-115k and for beverages is from 10k-30k
For service is really good and fast service.
I love their concept for outdoor seating and enjoying the garden. Parking area is spacious too

Great place to hangout, the air is very clean and cool. There is also outdoor table,so you can enjoy the view from above. The food is pretty good, and they have many kind of beverages, also the price is around 20k - 50k. I definately recommend this place for you to visit

Very relaxing and cosy dining experience here at Omah Kitir. Food and beverages are tasted well. Pricing is cafe standard and quite moderate. Staff is hospitable. Free wifi is available here. They have menus from local to Western style. They also serve hot and cold beverages. Great to visit during evening time. Parking is available at the road side."

One thing, I hope the owner read my review, there are some suggestion you have to fix. (Fot the owner:)
First, the water wasn't clean. It was dirty. I know it was from the source (When I open the faucet, the water is dirty). But you can consult with PDAM about it.
Second, is the french fries taken from freezer and you cook it anyway? And macaroni was too soft. I hope you can fix these foods soon.
For customers, it's still worth to have lunch/dinner here. The ambience is great, the taste is upper-mid, and I think this place is instagramable.

It's a nice n fresh ambience,worm cloth needed when u come at night. I suggest to the owner to adding more various menus.the food n beverages get point 6 for the taste

Good place for meeting friends but terrible place for dining. Price of food is ridiculous while quality is not good enough. I spent Rp.8k just for a bottle of 300mL mineral water. Also the main food is not what I expected.

As soon as I walked in, I was struck by the charming Chinese-themed decor, complete with an impressive collection of antiquities and old photographs of Indonesian landmarks.

The ambiance of the cafe was simply amazing with the old grandma style house and interiors, full of wooden style furniture that added to the overall charm of the place. The windows provided a stunning view of the nearby stream, accompanied by the soothing sound of flowing water. It was the most unique cafe I have ever been to, and I was immediately taken aback by the tranquility and serenity of the surroundings.

The menu was equally impressive, offering a range of delicious food and beverages. I tried their pisang bakar and it was one of the best I've ever had. The rate of the menu is very cheap as well.

All in all, I would highly recommend this cafe to anyone looking for a unique and memorable experience. The ambiance, the food, and the service are all outstanding, making it an ideal place to relax and unwind. I look forward to visiting again soon!

The decoration is superb, it's like an oriental museum. Perfect for someone who loves antique or unique building and someone who loves taking photo. The water sound came from the river and the fish pond make a relaxing ambiance. But sadly, there is no smoking room in this cafe so the visitor can smoking everywhere and it's make me uncomfortable. The taste of main menu is so so and a little bit salty. The tea is good tho. The price is really affordable

This place has so many beautiful spot, including the theme, building style which have unique design both the building and the interior (antique things), the garden, the fish pool and it‚Äôs surroundings that so homey, was really good for instagram and heaven for people who love taking picture. Foods and beverages was average enough. My two cents of this place would be the connection both menus and the ambiece, because the menus not-that-oriental antique, contradicts enough with the ambience.

Good vibes cafe with such a good books collection like Yuval Noah Harari's books. Not that pricey also. The menu's price ranged from around Rp. 10.000 - Rp. 30.000

Oriental style ~look like museum~ coffee shop with lots of antique stuffs inside. Menu is vary, especially light meal with very affordable price. Best table to sit is next to window where you can see a small river and bamboo trees. Collections bit dusty that are supposed to be well maintained to keep the existence."

Most favourite place to work. King coffee beer is good, but a milky base is perfect. recommended!

Spacious, with plenty options of indoor/outdoor. Perfect vibes for working, catching up with friends, or just having a peaceful alone-time. Food/drink prices are affordable, pastries are fresh and delicious, and coffee is acceptable.

Very nice pkqce to hangout, but is getting crowded very fast. Have many of electric socket. So you can doing your work in here. Nice vibe and outdoor is very cool when the night come. Price for the drink is reasonable. I like the coffe latte and summer time.

A comfy place with wide places and there's also smoking area and AC area. The beverages was pretty good with affordable price. The only downside in this place is the toilet just only few. They need to add more for this cafe in the future. Overall, good cafe that you can get in the town.

The white nuance, which is also obtained from the fence, some of the furniture, and the door and window frames, makes Bataputi Coffee House a clean and attractive photo backdrop. Coupled with a beautiful cafe environment, surrounded by trees and ornamental plants from the outside to the inside, Bataputi Coffee House has remained as a favorite cafe in Malang since its establishment in 2015.

Many potential photo backgrounds at Bataputi Coffee House. The most favorite is the outer part of the cafe, which has white rattan tables and chairs. We can take photos with 3 backgrounds at once: a wooden gazebo which is part of the smoking area, the Bango River and the trees on its banks that divide Araya Housing, and the magnificent Araya Bridge. Now the chandelier that adorns the Araya Bridge lights up brightly before night falls. Not only does it add to the coolness of your photo background, but it also makes the night atmosphere warm and romantic!

Just open every day at 3 pm, on weekends Bataputi Coffee House starts to get busy at 5 pm. Visitors generally aim to sit in the gazebo and non-smoking rooms that are air-conditioned and have sofas. Besides being a fun place, the food and drinks offered by Bataputi Coffee House are affordable. We tasted two coffee drinks recommended by the friendly cafe staff, namely avocado coffee and the other which is only available on weekends, es kopi susu tempo doeloe.

The coffee in avocado coffee is still quite dominant even though it is served with vanilla ice cream. So if you like light coffee, the creamy tempo doeloe iced coffee is more suitable. Moreover, the special thing is that this milk coffee ice is served with market snacks, the types of which depend on availability.

Heavy meals range from pizza, burgers, to rice, pasta and noodle based ones. Afternoon is the right time for snacking, so we ordered two snacks that cost around tens of thousands of rupiah: fried bananas, gula Jawa and onion rings. The onion rings are crunchy and delicious to eat warmly. However, you must order the Javanese sugar fried banana, which is not sprinkled with meises and cheese as usual, but in a traditional style with a sprinkling of brown sugar and young coconut.

Bataputi Coffee House

Open: Monday-Sunday 15.00-23.00 WIB

One of the best cafes in Malang to relax, unwind, and be close to the nature. It's really difficult finding a caf√© that has a good view and not just fake plants inside the building for pure decorative purpose. Bataputi has a wide selection of food & beverages, and in my experience, they all taste good.

Prices are reasonable, staffs are helpful. Wifi could be improved a little bit, especially in the outdoor area. But all in all, a perfect choice for a 'me time' or to hang out with friends and family.

To be honest I was a bit unsure to come to this place until last month. It was driven by the fact that lots of eatery and coffee house were open offering merely their good look.
Bataputi, however, indeed has good look especially for its interior and location by the river bank,and offers great food. I find the basic menu, such as fried rice, satisfactory. The fresh ingredients and combination of spices bring the savor everyone is looking for. Should one need to indulge in some comfort food accompanied by friendly coffee while enjoying afternoon breeze, Bataputi is the one to visit. The best time to be here is from 3-6 p.m.
The prices might be higher than average around Malang but it worth the money spending for.

The outdoor area is so comfy with pool and coffee table with chair, while the indoor area is bright, clean and cozy. The toilet is big and clean.

I really like this place, definitely would come back and be my choice to spend my time to leisure or working. This restaurant concept is Scandinavian themed, from the design, language, choice of food on the menu, and anything in it.

The taste of their food especially the fried rice is excellent, very tasty and lot of beef. The drink is also good. The snacks i bought, french fries, is also good on the sauce. Tha price is fair with the taste and quality. The place overall is also good and well built.

There are plenty of seat, outdoor, indoor, either on first or second floor. Lot of facility is available, toilet, musholla, valet parking for car, etc. The staff is also friendly and kind, and their service is made me satisfied. There's also live music on weekdays night if I'm not mistaken. They also sell bread here, so there's a bakery or patisserie in here.

went here for brunch and it was perfect. The place was great, every single spot is absolutely instagram worthy. Various menu from snacks, desserts and drinks and they're ALL so pretty. Most of the customers come with their friends or family. Or you can just go by yourself, doing some online task from laptop while enjoying some of their snacks

It's a little bit crowded in the weekend, but still can enjoy the good atmosphere. You can enjoy a life music here. For me, I don't really like the atmosphere if want to spend a long day :("

Coffee was simply satisfying, one of the best in town. In general, this cafe feels like an oasis in the hustle and bustle of Malang, where you can escape for a caffeine fix.

Best coffee in Malang (in my opinion), and their burnt basque cheese cake, is the best I have ever tried.

The most important thing is the internet connection is great: fast & stable. Physical distancing is applied. They put partition between the table. Indoor and outdoor space are available.

Tasty food and drinks. Their taste are unique and gorgeous. Cozy place for spending time, working, or meeting. Also, there's a room seems like meeting room for 6/ 8 people or more maybe. Price is not cheap, start from around 30 thousand rupiahs, yet worth to try"

Original review:
My Surabaya friend took me to this cafe.
It is an ideal place to dine, chat, or doing university assignments here.

Polite and friendly service.
Dishes were served quickly and nicely.

The menu provides a wide choice of food, and the taste of the food we ordered were all flavorful.
The cafe even donate 10% of milk cafe to support children‚Äôs education.

The next day before I left Surabaya, I order chicken mentai with rice again, the rice was well-packed.

Very good dessert & coffee. Very nice service. And even though the place isnt that big, the good interior makes the place comfortable :)

The price is affordable & the place is very clean also. Love it!

Cozy little cafe. Their pancake and waffle are so yum! Been coming back here again and again for sweet treats

Try another branch of Demandailing Cafe, and now I try different menu. I ordered scotch egg with vegetable curry, and it was tasty as always! Such a great style of eggs and I like it!

I ordered through an online application. The package was awesome, completed by a wet tissue and cutlery.

Looks small but very convenient.  Food and drink are very good. Especially the coffee is fantastic.  Many choices of food, pancakes and variety of cakes.  must try."

such a cozy place with affordable price, so many cats which i love!

Good place for deep talking or just hanging out with friends

Best place to hangout in Malang. It is literally in a garden, besides they have lots of pet strollin arround. you wont be surprise to see cats, birds, turtle stroling around the cafe. green and so refreshing here.

The owner should provide more indoor seats. In case of rain, the customers will not get wet.

I didn't feel comfortable with the crowd during the rain. All the customers who sat outside before, entered the indoor seat and it became full.

Very comfy toilets and praying room. Lots of seats with many options of seating to choose from. Good food and great atmosphere to do work in. Air conditioner everywhere. Not very busy during lunch hours.

Arrived here around 8.30pm and was slightly disappointed that most of the items on the menu were sold out. Ordered their matcha latte (M) and was again disappointed by the taste and overpriced price for such simple drink. Tasted too sweet, and too ‚Äúinstant‚Äù. Didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all. My friend ordered popcorn caramel drink and there was no caramel taste at all. Also too sweet.

We looking forward to try the almond croissant but unfortunately it already sold out. So we try strawberry danish and meat pie, which pretty decent but still not what we expect from the lot of good reviews written. Personally, prefer the pastry to be more flaky and the filling both sweet or savour more balanced. Place is indeed pretty picturesque if you like to take a photo but not that much place for dine in. I recommend to come in the morning if you want to try all their selection and want to dine in.

My fave pastry place! They have various options of pastry, super tasty with affordable price. The place is cozy and instagramable, it‚Äôs a nice place for hangout in the afternoon or after office time. Unfortunately the coffee isn‚Äôt so good. And sometimes most of the bestseller items are sold out, but they usually restock it again at noon. If you want to try their various or bestseller items i suggest to come around 9-11am. But i still love this place, everything beside the coffee is nice, the pastries, the place, the staff even the parking man is friendly n has a good manner!

Reallyyy super delicious. The croissant is not too expensive. The original croissant priced for 16k only. But beware of the queue because it can be an hour long of wait or more. Place is cute too with the red themed decoration."

Cashier was also nice but I believe she could‚Äôve worked faster. If you‚Äôre muslim, there‚Äôs mushala so you won‚Äôt skip a prayer. Parking lot is super limited just so you know.

Honestly, i came here just because Alun-alun Batu were closed (ppkm thing i supposed) and couldn't get a parking lot. Not expecting anything special, but i was shocked because of the portion. Really not worth the money. Like i only have to pay more because the place is famous and has some good photo spots? Not to mention the fact that you need to pick your order by yourself. I mean, for that price they should give customers a better service.

Last Saturday night, my friend and I go for a walk around Batu town square. We feel thirsty and hungry. So, we were look for a place to eat. Because it's almost midnight, many cafe and restaurant are closed. However, we found one cafe still open. The cafe is named Susu Ketan Pak Yan. The cafe is located next to a gas station on Jalan Diponegoro Batu. The cafe is open 24 hours. Finally, we entered the cafe and ordered somethings. My friend ordered matcha ice and I ordered a hot cappuccino and milk sticky rice with cheese. The cappuccino tastes like any other cappuccino, not bad, I like it. The matcha ice taste is also delicious and the sticky milk is sweet with lots of cheese. The price of food and drinks served is quite cheap. The waiter is friendly. The place is also comfortable with a beautiful view on the 3rd floor, but unfortunately some of the tables that had been used were not cleaned immediately. I think it's because so many customers came. But in general, this cafe is recommended if you want to enjoy sticky rice with a beautiful view.

Nice place, maybe...
Sometime need to enjoy the place..

Good place for chillin and hangout with your friends. The price in a lil bit pricey, but worth the quality. But the ice tea is pricey because it served with a plastic glass, seperti di kaki lima.

Overall the price is not really expensive. Drink start from rp.5000 and food start rp.8000. I tried nasi i goreng gila, taste so so. And iga bakar also so so. Good place to take picture.

This place is a good choice for making your timeline so awesome, why ? Bcs this place is in the rooftop, when you come to this place, you need to use a lift and this place in 4th floor.

First time coming here and I wasn‚Äôt impressed with what they offered on paper. Or perhaps because I‚Äôve spent considerable amount of emotional cost just to find the location. It was barely visible from the busy street on that Saturday night. However, it only took one bite to calibrate my frustrated mind cause the food was fantastic. My brother and I tried three dishes and my entire mouth was gladly participating. Chicken was tender. Beef was tender and super moist. Seasoning was on point. I don‚Äôt know about the rest of the menu tho. I‚Äôll come back later.

I have no complaint for anything about the food. It taste good, fair portion for the price. Waiters are all giving their best service. I just not really enjoy the ambience. I don't get the concept. It's too formal to be a cafe, but it's too loud and casual to be a fine dining place. I hope they could work this out, because i love their Nasi Seafood Siram Woku and looking forward to have another dine in.

Good food, big portion, and clean place. Although the price is expensive, the taste and the portion are worthed. The service is very welcome. I can say ""it is one of the best restaurant in Malang"".

Good food, even I can say the price is so cheap for delicious and  cool plating ..

The food is okay (although it was served not quite warm) but the service is very bad. First, you have to wait a long time for your food. Secondly, I don't understand why tourists have to pay in advance when Indonesians can pay just like in any decent restaurant, after eating a meal, just before leaving.
I don't really know what the reason is, is it racism against white people?
If you are trying to copy European/American standards then improve your customer service because unfortunately you don't have much chance to attract more customers with this behavior.
It's a pity because you could have found yourself in a large guide about Indonesia and now you will become viral on TikTok.
Unfortunately, you are the worst restaurant we ate at during our Southeast Asia trip."

One of the recently opened cafes in Gubeng Kertajaya, its vibrant surroundings, and its vast space makes it the most visited in the Gubeng area, first time here but already attracted to it. It's in the between of expensive and affordable, the cheapest drink is around 10k and the highest 28k, ordered Teh Tarik Gula Aren, the flavor is almost similar to Thai Thea. There are indoor spaces and outdoor, for smokers it's wise to stay outdoor so as not to bother other people. The cafe is Highly recommended.

the place is quite big, small parking area but could use the side of the main road, taste is just ok, moderate price. so noisy with band and music that you have to shout if you want to talk, as if you were in the club. no capacity restriction, even the staff put the mask as if it was a sling bag.

Definitely recommended!

The place, for it's part of UB, is quite comfortable to hang out in. It has prayer room (musholla) and restroom available for the guests. I guess the menu has been changed since the first time I visited the place. I think, some food are somewhat pricey. The chicken salad is great, so is the tomyam soup. But the snacks are overpriced since they, in my opinion, are far from satisfying.

great place to hang out, eat and drink with friends.

came here because one of my friend suggested to try this place. it was good. the ambience was the typical coffee shop with bustling sounds of people hanging out with their friends or clacking sounds of people working from the cafe. the food came out good, but not that tasty. the food was a bit expensive, if I must say.

AADK is a high class concept! One of the best cafe where keeps an indoor and outdoor area. The ambience of the first floor is very suitable to create a warm friendship, sharing love and laugh. There's a photobox there and every corner is so instagramable. The atmosphere of the second floor is really appropriate to engage communication and find solution. There's a space to be a workplace and having intense conversation. The service is good, the menu is also unquestionable, and the price is normal and affordable.

A little downside is that they took around +-40 minutes to prepare for our BBQ ribs although from what we saw the cafe was not that crowded last night. Also, the narrow parking area is a bit of a problem.

Yet overall I'd recommend you to eat at Communal.

a comfortable coffee place to do assignments, and also talk with friends, the coffee is delicious, the prices are not expensive, many choices of snacks such as donuts and pestris which are also very tasty, the place is cozt, clean and well lit, lots of seating and a large parking area, fast service and friendly too.

Good coffee from an array of beans available here. The place is spacious and the ambience is nice. The beverages are at a considerable price.

I love this place.  You can go to place and get a good coffee and delicious donnat. This place so cozy so you can work or meeting.  Thus place are recommended for hang out with friends.

Nice place to have a small meet up with your friends, strategic location, delicious snack, and good ""STMJ"" which literally means drink made of Milk, Egg, Honey and Ginger. And remember if you intend to come on Saturday night, this place will be a little bit overcrowded.

My first time going there
I went there around 10pm and it was so crowded
Tbh it was so cold, so if you can't bear the coldness, prepare your jacket, since it's Malang's night.
This was the first stmj i drink in malang.
Oh, STMJ means Susu Telur Madu Jahe (Milk with egg, honey and ginger)
I ordered regular STMJ and my friend ordered chocolate SMJ (Milk with honey and ginger), also some tofu and toast
It was so crowded and it was Saturday, that we wait the drink for 40 minutes.
Bcs it was my first time there, idk wether that was categorized as long time or not.
But we waited the drink and food for long time ( in my opinion ).
The stmj was good, I didn't feel the raw egg.
And the tofu was smooth. The toast also good.
Overall, all fine, except the time we used for waiting. But it's okay.

Good prices. With street place. A lot of variant of food. Good portion of the food. But maybe little bit not comfort if you sit out.

Simple place. Nice local food"

I am a bit surprised because they provide sanitary pads for women in the toilet. That is really rare and for me it's good.

My son n I ordered big breaky n good morning Melbourne. The meals were delicious, scrambled eggs were soft n well seasoned. The croissant was crunchy, my son said his meal was perfect. We were given a free dessert, it's good but for me the waffle was a bit too sweet. I like the vanilla ice cream

Lovely place indeed. I really love the clean, white, minimalist yet cozy interior.

They have a spacious indoor and outdoor area. But there aren't many power sockets tho, kinda annoying. But then again, maybe this place isn't suitable for work? Idk.

They have quite various menus from food to drinks. The food is good, but I don't think that coffee is their strong selling point here. But their staff is so friendly, so that's a plus.

I spent around 100k for 1 main food and 1 coffee.

Not a so wide coffee shop, but it's comfy enough. A bit pricey, but yeah you can have a good quality for the drink.

Cute little small cafe, good food, good coffee. Loved the ‚Äòlesehan‚Äô seating arrangement outside. However it‚Äôs still not my everyday-go-to cafe since it‚Äôs a tad bit overpriced for me.

The staffs were friendly, quick. The place, of course is the main attraction here. But the drinks were nothing special that prices around 25-29k. the mushroom pizza was fine tho. french fries is just like the regular french fries in some other restos, which fast food branches still taste better.

I came here on the weekend and it is too crowded... Every table is placed too close from one another, I'm wondering if they correctly follow the pandemic protocol for cafe/restaurant (?) Especially the indoor dine-in area... isn't that too crowded? They should lessen the tables

The food is good
The staffs, especially the security is sooooo friendly and helpful ‚ô°

The pizza and the burger tastes nice. Staffs were kind of friendly. The location is quite nice as well although it's very small. The problem is that it took way too long for the food to come out. That's the thing that gives an illusion of this place being crowded at all times. Not because of they have a lot of customers, but because of slow service. Had the food taste bad, I would've rate it 1/5.

Adorable and cozy cafe in heart of Malang not so crowded. Decorated well in Bali style we love the ambiance so much. Drink was great although food not meet my expectations. Staffs were very friendly and attentive."

The place is cozy to do some tasks or even to chill out with your friends. They got various menu of beverage and food with reasonable prices. They provide free WIFI for customers, toilets for both men and women, and a praying room. What I dislike is that there are mosquitos here, it seems like they never do any fogging. The cup for hot tea can be better than a minimarket cup. Over all, ok lah. Come and prove it on your own!

have spacious layout, complete choice area whether u want indoor or outdoor. i would recommend this place as it‚Äôs not as crowded compare with it‚Äôs surrounding caffes

and the food, since i haven‚Äôt found any different with other caffe/resto i‚Äôd love to say it‚Äôs another mainstream place in jogja.

it's a cozy place especially for studying and chit-chats, but the drink i ordered was a bit dissapointing. i had their ""bestselling"" caramel latte (kopi susu karamel). the syrup made my throat sore and i had to buy a bottle of mineral water, which would have bought anyway since the wifi can only be accessed through one device! they give you a specific username & password per purchase for it ‚Äî which made me at least go to the cashier twice (i wanted to use my laptop + phone). they also round up the prices to the nearest thousands after taxing 10%.

anyhow, the place was quite huge and both the outdoors & indoor area are clean. the toilet was as well but the locks aren't as secure as i had hoped. to sum it up, konkrite was a new experience for me and i'd keep a look out on more of their subtle tricks next time.

They have a fast internet connection! The first floor is nice to hang out with friends. The second floor is really quiet so it's a nice place to work and study. Affordable price for a good taste. You have to scan a qr code to see their menu. My favorite is definitely Matchaberryüòç
Their Potato wedges and cold brew coffee are great too!

I like this place. It is comfortable to do work. The food and beverages quite good. The price is also affordable for students.  It is clean and bright. If you go there at noon, somehow you'll feel hot inside so you may choose to be at the outdoor.
In the afternoon to evening, it's getting crowded and full of students and they have discussion or just chit chat loudly so somehow the place is too noisy."

Always trust your guts when it tells you not to visit some place. Once I ignored and I got this unpleasant experience. Place a bit fancy, but not with their food and beverages. Coffee's no good at all, and I got undercooked rice on my meal (and they took forever to served it). I didn't bother to complain because I was too exhausted. Definitely will not coming back.

New coffeeshop in town. I tried Cappuccino Royal (double shots capp) with 20k for the price and I would give 7,8/10 for the taste. The location was so strategic and kind of hectic to find a parking place, but not that hard. They have many menus with affordable price, and snacks. Also has 2 floors and their good services would made me to come back later!

Not bad, there were a lot of food and beverage options and they tasted quite decent for such a little place. Interior is excellent, however the only downside is the small parking area which can be pretty dangerous since it is close to the busy main road.

Best place to chillin and work with the loved one. i ain't believe that this place served macchiato cause most of coffee shop in town didnt served it well."

A Bali vibes cafe in Surabaya.
The food and drink are good enough. The price also affordable.
Therefore, when we go there at noon, it will be very hot. The AC place is not large so enough for only several people.

And there are some of menu poster with low price but only can be ordered at 10PM.

A good cafe with sort of Mediterranian met Bali Beach Club ambiance. The nuance was comfy and relaxing. Quite instgrammable. Depending on the weather, usually it was hot in the noon.
The food & drink were quite good actually. The menu ranged from 25K to 60K. One small problem though, it had limited parking space for cars.

A good vibe cafe. A cozy and comfy one.
Visited here due to some recommendations and here I am on reviewing this place as my first impression herw.
Food and drink: various kind of them. Nasi Bali is recommended (ordered it twice, guys üòãüòÇ).
PRICE: Under 50K IDR I think.
Design: unique and refreshing since it feels like we're not in Surabaya.
Additional offer:
-. Snack like cinnamon rolls, brownies, etc. are offered here.
-. There's a thrift shop at the corner of this place with affordable price also (start from 25K and 30K).

Go check it out, guys.
Have a good time!

A cute tiny tropical cafe in Surabaya but feels like in Bali. The interior design is really beautiful. They sell light snacks and beverage. Only have 3 menu for heavy meal. Their cookies is pretty delicious. The cleanliness is not really good, I mean, not the stuffs or foods. I found a very big bold spider in the indoor area and a little flying-bug inside tissue box, but i believe they come from outdoor area, it's nature. Hope they care more about the bugs that shouldn't be in indoor area.
I recommend you guys to come when the sun is going down, because the temperature in Surabaya at noon is really uncomfortable. The indoor area is smaller than outdoor, so it would be best to enjoy the tropical vibes after 2 or 3p.m."

Despite having a casual setting, it had the higher-end service feel as the staffs were all helpful and friendly. Food and drinks definitely have the potential to be amazing with some tweaks and improvements.

Currently staying in the co-living space for few days and decided to try food in this cafe for dinner. I ate Pesto Pasta and drink Lemon Squash. The drink is satisfying, no complaints there. As far as the Pesto Pasta goes, the sauce is great but I wish it would mesh better with the pasta. But it still works as a comfort food to me, plus the ambience is rather magical at night. With the price (which rather premium for my taste), this is a great place to visit and to enjoy good food. üëç keep it up!

The foods and drinks tasted good. The interior design makes you feel comfy. But only few plugs provided. If you want to work using laptop I suggest you to charge it first before visiting there.

This place allows you to enjoy gelato while being accompanied by lots of cats.

The flavour options are decently varied with several drinks menu also. There weren't any way we could order food for the cats however during time of visit. The service was okay.

There are enough seating available and decent parking space.

There are various cats going around. There are also some hedgehogs nested on some of the tables.

This caffe is for you who love cat but dont have time to keep it at home.
This is my first time come grooming my cat. While waiting I can play with cuties cats here. They are friendly cats you can cuddle them but some also not keep miaoming when I close to him.
The caffe dont have much menu to order .  They said kitchen dammage. Is small caffe and no cat playground for jump etc

There are a lot of cute cats, but the strong smell of cat's letter box really made me unwilling to stay inside. Really hope they can manage good ventilation to reduce the smell, or perhaps putting the litter boxes in separate rooms.

We came here for the first time. The first impression, this place suits truly for cat lovers. The customers can play with the kitties while having a meal. But it's not working like that on us.
While we'd had our dinner, they jumped over our low table. We just concerned on the tidiness of the foods from the cat's fur.

The space is quite small for a cafe. Or it's better to  segregate between cat's playing room and the diningroom."

Plus point for their nice, quiet and cozy ambience. But not a fan for what they serve. Coffee taste not so good, and their mashed potato is bland with no creamy taste at all. Or maybe I just pick the wrong dish? Improve your dishes and drink, and maybe I'll consider another visit.

Will definitely be my favourite coffee shop in Malang. The coffee is superb! Try pour over V60 Gayo wine beans. Sooo light and clear. And surprisingly, it's not really expensive for such a fragrant and tasty coffee. The place? So much greeny and peaceful. It's got a concept a vintage house. A house during Dutch colonization.

It is around farm field with great views and nice breeze of wind.
Live music on the weekend.
It is understandable if become hectic in prime hours.

I ordered sego sambel tongkol since they said it is the signature dish. It was too dry, both the rice and tongkol. The iced-coffee was too sweet. However, the ambiance is so-so but it doesn't match with its name 'Swara Alam'. I didn't hear any natural voices at all. Supposed to be they build a miniature fountain or pond inside so we could hear the sound of gurgling water.

Aight, im tryna be fair, most of complaints are about lack of service, especially food & snack service on prime time. So far I've never got unstatisfying treatment from the waiters (I hope it wouldn't be happened).

cukup bagus sejauh ini, mungkin perlu adanya peningkatan manajemen servis ketika prime time / full house.

Spacious outdoor cafe in the heart of Kepanjen City. Cozy and homey and it surrounded by a rice paddy field so it pleases you when you visiting here. There are many menu to choose, the price is affordable and the taste is okay for the price. Definitely gonna go back here sometime when I crosses this city again.

Good food
Good people

One of my best finding in Malang. Suitable for your focus time, nice location, good coffee and barista.

Decent place for working or anything related, they also provide best banana cake in Malang.

Mmmm is one of my favorite coffee shop in Malang. Definitely, they offer you specialty coffee with high quality coffee beans. I usually try their cappuccino with guest beans and also the single origin (both imported or local beans). The ambience is cozy to chill. One of my fav place to chill and work.

Recommended by my friend who said by his/her friend that this cafe serve the best coffee in town

I'm trying manual brew and use import beans from Andrew roastwork

Cant comment anything to this brewer, its 100% solid perfect taste!

and the cookie its very good and cheap, only 10k

It gets all 5 stars from me. Just go there if you like non-vegetarian food, don't be skeptical at all. We ordered two burgers and two cappuccinos. The burgers were exceptionally tasty and the coffee was delicious too. We ordered a pork and a beef burger. The place is quiet and very very airy. Reasonably priced cafe. The portions were more than what we could eat. This place remained a highlight of our (me and my husband) 10-day trip to Bali.

Easily one of the best coffees I have had so far in Bali (long black). Loved this place and the food is genuinely food with it being a great choice for vegans & vegetarians. Parking is mainly for scooters and not recommended for cars. Definitely worth a visit even if your going to just have a coffee here

Nice and easy restaurant close to Padang Padang in the south of Bali. Food is delicious and staff is extremely friendly. Healthy and vegan food highly recommended. Seems like the guys really love what they are doing. Definitely worth the slightly higher price. Went there three times already. Always delicious üëå

Built Cafe was our first stop for food in Bali and we‚Äôll definitely be back again. Open air, warm and friendly service, delicious food in large servings, and a perfect introduction to Bali for us!

Nice place. Have in door and out doors. Good environment. Good coffee. The servants are very welcome. It is in sun city mall so you can walk in mall if you get bored sitting in cafe. It is in center of sidoarjo city. It is also sell cake and merchandise too.

Great experience having coffee or tea here, as always. Super friendly baristas, great service. They often offer promo and star rewards for Starbucks card holder. The place itself is great, located inside a mall which you have to pay for the parking fee. Inside the Starbucks, the seating area is very comfy, they apply social distancing protocols to avoid physical contact to each customer. They also provide plastic to hold your tumblr to avoid physical contact. Great place to work, because they have good speed wifi here. I think this is really a coffee place between your home and your office hehe... i am a tea person. So, my recommendation would be hot chai tea with additional milk, or if you like it sweeter, you can ask for additional vanilla syrup.

one of my escape place to work.
The crews are nice and friendly.

Update..

the place here is very nice to use to hang out, have food & drinks at low prices.
there is a slight lack in their service which makes me a little frustrated.. because here you will be told to leave even though you still want to hang out at that place, they should offer a menu instead of telling people to leave.

When I came, they had a DJ show. I like that the music is not too overwhelming and could still be a good companion for a peaceful night out. The fish and chips is good!

The atmosphere here is really unique, different from the usual coffee shops with bright or monochrome color tones. Blackbarn is rather dimly-lit and full of tribal-style decorations like dreamcatcher and antler wall mount. The Shakshuka tasted and reminded me of lasagna except that it tasted eggy. On the other side, the Spaghetti Meatball turned out pretty filling. The tomato sauce was a bit too sweet while the beef meatballs were overly salty. Prices are practically reasonable given the central location (good news, there are no tax and service charge here).

A monochromatic coffee shop in central Surabaya. The price is quite high for a so-so taste of a drink. But it's got a cozy ambience. Quite a good place to hang out with your friends or relatives.

The place is so comfortable, very good vibes, old country was playing the whole time such as the name ""Barn"".

Food and Drink were really great and satisfiying. I highly recommend the Spaghetti Carbonara, it tasted similiar to the original italian pasta.

My fave beverage is the rosella, so refreshing and tasty. I once ordered the curry katsu, and it was so pleasing. The baristas are helpful and friendly. They will briefly explain and help you to choose the menu.

The cafe has outdoor and indoor sections; I like to stay in their indoor area because the ambiance is so pleasant, and we can see the baristas making beverages behind the bar.

The cafe is recommended for you to hang out with your friends.

The location is a bit hidden, in the middle of farmfield, and away from crowd. However, the place is usually full. They offers a good coffee with reasonable prices.

The foods and snacks are good. The seats and lights also good. I know this is a coffee shop, and most of the customers only looking for one drinks or one snacks, but I think they should consider to create meal+drink package for customers who do not drink coffee and looking for heavy meal here.

This was my first visit. I asked the cashier about the difference between latte and dolca, which one had less strong coffe. The cashier patiently answered my question and that was a great experience. When my order was ready, they called my name through the speaker. I am not an expert about coffee but their coffee was good and fulfill my expectation. I took an outdoor seat and it was fun and breezy. Overall, I had a great experience here.

The location is not beside the main road, so it's more quite. The place is good for people who wants to drink some coffee and stay or sit longer comfortably with friends.
.
If you don't like coffee, there are alternative drinks like chocolate milk, tea, etc.

There are two areas; inside with aircon, and outside for people who smokes cigarettes or just want some fresh air.

Good alternate for hangout with friends. Located in Pogung where most of the college student lives so you can easily find it, the pricing list is quite decent for a coffee.

One of the few restaurants in Malang that serve authentic Acehnese cuisine. The food are delicious! Mie Aceh and Teh Tarik is a must-try. Price is affordable, not too expensive.

You'll love the atmosphere, I guarantee. The scenery is just breathtaking!

Nice view, good food, relative little expensive

I have to say that the food was quite expensive, lol. You will need to spend around 100k per person if you want to visit this place. However, they do have a nice atmosphere since it is located in Batu area.

You can see the city view and enjoy the breeze while enjoying your foods. I recommend visiting this place after sunset since the viwe will be prettier.  I tried nasi Betutu and it was nice but little bt too salty. Ordered lemon ginger honey too to complement the chill weather, but unfortunately, the weather made the drinks cold too fast.

Good coffee and service.... The ambience and the view are marvelous... Recommended"

The food provided is quite varied, but there are quite a lot of foods made from bread here.for those of you who quite like sweet and fragrant food, this is perfect.Halal food, and reasonable price.

Surprised to see the very spacious area of this cafe. I like their cozy setting, plenty of seating options, and the playlist, wifi, and electrical socket are suitable to do some work.

Price is very affordable, and their matcha tastes quite good.

However, the food menu is limited and most of them are stored cold (they just reheat them when we order). Also, the bathroom is only available on the first floor.

Nice cafe with great ambience. Not too crowded so it's suitable for studying. The food is average but the tea is delicious. Definitely will go back here. The place is quite hidden, in the 2nd floor of a building.

It is located on the second floor of Wikacell on Soekarno Hatta street. It's a cozy place to work, study, or just hangout with friends. Menus are varied and reasonably priced. There is a toilet on the first floor and a prayer room on the third floor. Overall this cafe is very comfortable.

Nice place for working while having a coffee and pastry.
When you buy something you get a wifi code that's valid on the same day, for 6 hours and 2 devices."

2019 update
Texture is worse, almost crumbly. It's not how gelato should be. Lowered the star to 3.

2017 review:
Ice cream doesn‚Äôt have the real gelato texture which is smooth & silky.

I will skip the food if I go here.

Coffee is bad (mediocre Robusta)

Delicious ice cream, recommended, though the place is small, and the ice cream variety, most is mixture of 2, some are more than 2 flavor. I ordered the rumble crumble and its pretty good, its a mixture of kitkat and rum, also another recommend is the thatea, pistachio, and red wine chocolate (not sure if everyone gonna like the redwine one). Price wise is cheap to moderate.

One of a good gelato bar in east of Surabaya. Not just selling gelato, here you can order a well made and tasty meal such as bacon and egg spaghetti, katsu sandwich and many more with a wise price.

It is not a huge place, does not have plenty seatings, but such a nice modern dining/dessert place. They have free wifi, high chairs, toilets, parking and an outdoor seating area.

I like chocolate a lot and the dark chocolate gelato is a star. Moreover, they serve coffee too. It is really a one stop dining experience. Starter, meals, coffee, desserts, are all available."

The seating is fun and the design of the cafe is fun and bright. The sandwiches taste nice, although the mayo is a tad sweet and the beef sandwich needs at least 2 pieces to be able to taste the meat. The truffle chips were delicious. The coffees were good. The front and back of  house had a mix up with our order and at first didn't seem to know how to fix it but before we left they offered a free takeaway sandwich which made up for it.

I think here is the most aesthetic place between all of the Janji Jiwa outlets. Toast is very worth the price! Coffee is good. Place is nice and clean. Free parking is what makes this place better. Highly recommended thing to spend time and money.

Music too loud the waitress got my order wrong twice. Weird chair selection for one table, one chair is a sofa chair, and one is a wooden chair without a backrest.

nice toast but unfortunately the staff  it's so noisy

Best toast in town.."

What a great experience of eating Durian! The price was also reasonable and the view was ok. It's giving the new experience to eat Durian and see the Durian trees around, meaning that the Durian is as fresh as we can get!

But the only to improve was on the kpop music that kept played, that was the atmosphere breakerüòÖ

It's located on the hills, so i call this place is embarassing place to take a relax because the sightseeing was beautiful while you get lunch with various recipe, javanese/ traditional recipe with a delicious taste, or you can choose from fried rice, or fried noodle, or lalapan and there are many kind of coffe that you can select.. and of course there are many durian trees, you can choose, taste, pay and enjoy it with your family or your collegues, also you can take away both of the food or durian.. it has big parking area and it has many gazebo.. you also can do reservation first... so try it

Nice place to enjoy sightseeing and be refreshed.. Durian trees are everywhere. Can buy durian and Indinesian food and drinks with reasonable price. We can choose what to eat from many variaties of durian. Monthong or local, both are delicious. There will be a live music available after the stage is ready (under construction). About 30 minutes from Malang. Well, must drive carefully because relatively small streets to reach there (but smooth). Recommended place for durian lovers..

The location is very strategic. The menu is vary. There are snacks and various drink such as coffee, tea, milk, and juices. The prices are reasonable. Cars and motorcycles can park at the side of the Mataram Street in front of it. There is a toilet. There is a paid wifi (wifi.id). It's nice.

a comfortable place to hang out, chat while listening to live music

My first impression was good to visit here for the first time. I got pleasantly service by the parking staff. He was welcome me,and helped me to set up my desk and asked where i like to sit and bring the menu too. Thank you sir.
At the cashier, that 2 young man staff were also friendly and polite. They answered my question when i asked where prajurit coffee is come from. They also explained the menu well. Thanks brothers...

I like the taste of prajurit coffee, the strawberry ice tea, ice cream, and french fries. For the price, for me is just okey. And the environment is nice. I enjoyed it. Every sat and sun there is live music entertainment. You wanna sing, then just welcome hehe or you want to request, also fine.

I ate spring rolls and there's a chicken bone inside

And there's no signature dish in this bistro , just typical cafe's dishes but it's overpriced

The drink kinda overprice for a small size of a flavoured tea without any topping

And the employee doesn't dress up well as the ""price"" they have

Either lower the price or make it more worth the price

For the bathroom, the design actually very fascinating, but the toilet are not in a good condition , there's tissue everywhere , the shower are about to broken. As the place are consider as ""overprice"" at least give us a good facilities

Yummy food, great decoration, good service!
Reasonably priced for fine dining.
The place is not too large, yet not too small.

But the food took quite long to come out, and the dessert were placed in the same time as main dish, it would be better if they ask us about when it should comes out.

Overall keep up the good work :)

Nice place to enjoy your meal. For chilling, or chit chat with friends.

Good ambience cafe, like inside the arc, but the table not so many.... have a private space and outdoor space that too dark at night... the food is quiet good.... overall price is medium high

The bad part is, the service here is so poor, we have to wait for about 45 minutes just for a frappe. We got the wrong order but when we complain, they insist that we ordered that item. So ignorant, no responsibility. And they once took our food, said the food is wrong, and about 15 minutes later they bringing back the food that they took before, the same food, and gave it back to us. Like nothing's wrong at all, without any apology or whatsoever.
And last, they got a piece of plastic inside my frappe!

I really dont like the service here.

Picture above is the environtment of the time I get here with friends. They are are arguing about the price and which items has been ordered and not. Because the waiters came with complicated items without ordered.. some of items we did not order they put in on the table and even we are said that we did not order it, they did not take it out. So complicated and less professional.
About the place itself actually quite cozy but the service was bad (very novice) based on my experienced.

It's the one of the best coffee shop in town. Nice coffee, delicious food and beverages, and nice place. We can enjoy the live music in here especially for Saturday night. The price is common as others

I love the cheeseburger tho! For 35k it's very worth it. The patty is so soft and it instantly melts in your mouth. Will come here again soon!

I love the design of this cafe so much. It's so beautiful and very aesthetic for Instagram. The design concept is different from other cafes. I tried the burger, fries, and the drinks (I forget the detail names). Everything is good. Me and my partner love the burgers! For the price, I think it's a lil bit on the expensive side so cannot go there as often as I want to. But yeah, definitely recommended and will come back again!

Good donuts, drinks is okay. But for me, the place itself is more attractive. They use modern minimalist concept with unfinished touch. Parking lot is huge, bigger than the cafee itself. Very comfy. Price is standard 6 donuts for idr 32.000.

It is worth the price. And it is quite cheap compare to other cafes in Malang.

However, it took soooo much time for the food to be ready. Maybe because it's always crowded with people.
Also, they played the music so loud. So you might reconsider to visit this place if you like a quiet place. But they also provide a special room for study or work, so you might use that.

Don't ride a car to visit this place, it's hard to find the parking lot.

Semusim Cafe is on St. MT. Haryono Malang, exactly across from Brawijaya University. This cafe has two floors which are always busy every day with visitors who are mostly students. This cafe sells cheap food and drinks so it is suitable for student pockets, prices start from 7,000 to 20,000. This cafe is open every day, open from 10.00 to 00.00. This cafe has a Scandinavian decoration concept so it is very interesting to visit. and apart from that this cafe also has air-conditioned first floor facilities, there are sockets on each table without worrying about running out of battery, as well as a prayer room for Muslim visitors. Meanwhile, the second floor is a smoking zone as well as a place to carry out tasks. This floor cafe is non-AC, it won't feel hot because of the lots of ventilation and the use of fans to provide extra comfort to visitors.

Price is so affordable. Taste is okay not so extraordinary, only got the problem with too much sweetness for the drink. Place is well and nice, so comfy and having a decent interior.

This place available 3 spaces, outdoor, 1st floor w/ kitchenette n 2nd floor (I'm not check yet).
As far as I know, the atmosphere is chilling. Recommended for who want to spend the time in Klaten.
For near future I'll be back to Brix for tasting the foods n another beverages.

The interior and its ambience is good. The staffs are also friendly. Recommended to spend time with your friends. The price is little bit expensive compared to the similar coffee shops.

A very lovely place, an instagramable place. If you like taking pictures or selfies, this is the right place for you to come. The interior design is pretty and the exterior looks like a castle. The price here is quite affordable, they served snacks, main dishes and dessert, but the drink option not as much as the food.

I love with the interior, chill and calm.. My fav tea is the one with lychee and rose flowers. Unfortunately the menu variations is not much..but if you wanna try Korean food, Seoul Scent just right next to this cafe..

Went there when they have ‚ÄúSarapan Gratis‚Äù promo and everything was soooo good üòç

Hidden gem that are not too busy, with carefully crafted menus.

Nice place, aesthetic in all parts indoor & outdoor, for drink I like sigurih the most. When I went there, it was cloudy and then after a while it started to rain. While the indoor area is not that wide, so there are some visitors who take shelter outside, I suggest it would be even better if the indoor area was expanded.

Also, when I ordered a cheese cake, the cashier said it was available, so I paid for it, but after a while she said it was sold out. Finally I ordered another cake and the cashier said the change would be given to me later but she didn't give it to me until I finally asked for it myself as I was planning to leave.

So please improve the service again, and hopefully it will get even better on my next visit, but overall this is a great place üòÖüåø‚òï

Great place for hanging out, various coffee from around Indonesia served here with many brewing styles. The ambience is cozy and homy, downside is unstable wifi connection.

quite a comfortable and aesthetic place. the menu is varied and the taste is also good. good drinks ranging from coffee and fresh drinks. good and friendly service. really a place to recommend.

When I visited here, there were several dishes w/ beef ingredients that weren't available, but any food menu available is delicious, n here is the first time i find YOMAD and try it.

A huge cafe with indoor and outdoor settings, the ambience was very good. A lot of picture area. You can carry kids and having no worries at all. The food was typical cafe food, tasted okay.

The first time i went to Sang Kudo, i was amazed with the place. From the outside it looks like some expensive cafes but once i see the menu, the prices are somehow cheap and not as expensive as i imagine it would be. I really love the vibe, the place is very beautiful, I'd say  Sang Kudo is one of the most beautiful cafe in Malang and Batu. I can't say anything about the food because the foods are as amazing as the place! Sang Kudo does not only sell vibes and comfy, but they also sell great foods!

The first day they had a few items not available, second day they had half of the breakfast menu unavailable and not ready yet, including everything we hoped to order. Got eggs Benny the first day which were great. Second day as we were limited in options we got the berry French toast and the breakfast burrito, which did not settle in our stomachs well at all. Presentation was good but maybe go for a late breakfast if you want all options. Lattes were good though.

My boyfriend and I drove a motorcycle from Kuta Beach to this place .  It's been a very long journey for me.  But it's worth it to eat amazing food.  very good music  I want everyone to try. The disadvantage is that there are no lights along the way.

We came here multiple times during our 2 month stay. Especially the la passion burger is delicious and well priced. The quinoa mushroom salad is a bit small for the price, but the taste is great. The volcano milkshake is a calory bomb - just what you want if you order it... Every wednesday is movie night once it becomes dark (best come there before 6)

I‚Äôve ordered the Green Superpower which was really good and creamy :). My daughter got a ham and cheese sandwich and although I don't appreciate to much that type of  the cheese that comes slides I did really appreciate what is the most important in a sandwich‚Ä¶ the bread‚Ä¶ very good brioche bred ‚Ä¶ I would pay more to have a better quality of cheese in this very very tasty bread üôà.
From Freakshakes, the Vulcano Rock very good if u want to forget about the calories that every shake comes with :))) ‚Ä¶ this one definitely will worth the extra gym day!
The pizza was good‚Ä¶ not your regular pizza dough (maybe because it‚Äôs a Mexican influenced restaurant) but still tasty and the fresh tomato side that we ordered separately‚Ä¶ was a very good one ‚Ä¶ tasted like a tomato and not plastic :)
Overall I would recommend this place , that also has a very nice island interior design .

We visited here twice in one day it was so good! We had a great lunch which tasted amazing and then visited again for some drinks in the evening.

We really enjoyed the live music and the atmosphere on Saturday evening was so fun and the staff were friendly! The decor is also really pretty.

The manager even tracked our email down from our hotel after our visit, to refund us as we had been accidentally overcharged the night before! This was not something we had noticed so were very grateful that they took the time and decency to resolve the issue.

If we‚Äôre back in the area we will definitely visit again!"

Very nice cafe with french vibes, serve good pastries and coffee, the service also very kind, good for chit chat,

The food is excellent. From main course to dessert, everything we have is very satisfying. If I have to pick, Egg benedict is the victor. Price is rather steep but obviously worth it. Atmosphere is the only thing that upset me a bit, AC is way too cold, it ruins the coziness. Overall, it's a great place to hang out.

Cozy and comfortable place to hangout with your loved one especially if you have pets. You can bring them in the outdoor area. The dining area was quite spacious (but be careful of caterpillars as they surrounded by big trees). The ice cream as good as usual and the staff was really friendly too.

I tried their Vegan Fuel something, consisting of soy milk, espresso and sugar. I actually loved it. For the food, I ordered their beef blackpepper rice. To me, it's just fine.
Unfortunately, since there was no indoor seating available, we had to pick outdoor tribune to enjoy our orders and it wasn't a nice experience. The weather was windy and a bit chilly, so you can imagine how uncomfortable it is. Plus, the tribune is not suitable for eating something served on a plate.

Went here for brunch and it was very perfect, the place was great, every single spot is absolutely instagram worthy.

Various menu from snacks, desserts and drinks and they're all so pretty and yummy. the cafe owner is very friendly to his customer.

The parking area is so wide. Once I enter the coffee shop, the waitress offered me to sit in the indoor area with sofa because she saw me with a baby. It has online order system with e-payment, but don't worry we can still pay with cash.
It's so comfortable because it also has praying room which is so clean.

Certainly a cozy place to hang out. Especially for the lads. Too bad we didn't photograph the scene, only the glass. A cafe with vintage interior and lots of lights, very quiet.

if i visit that area again, i will try to visit the other cafe.

The interior and decor here are worth mentioning, especially if you love anything Japanese. Make sure to dine in the shades since the outdoor area is super hot at noon. Drinks were okay except that they took soooo long to come.

And don't be afraid of the charcoal in your coffee - it has a affect of desinfection. And if you are hungry too you can try the rosted chicken heads or other delicious things.

Kopi susu joss is a must here, it is a milk coffee served with charcoal. They have various types of sundukan, it is a traditional satay contains chicken, tempura, quail eggs, and some other traditional foods. They open until midnight during pandemics, stay safe and put your mask on while chit chating ü§ó

The best one only kopi joss or ginger, all kind of satay was standart and most of all the satay have sweet taste, not suitable with me.
I dont think eat here was cheap because i have to pay 55.000 for two people, consist of 1 coffee milk joss, 1 ginger, 9 pcs of satay, 2 packs of rice.
Located in front of tugu train station and this angkringan was the biggest one and large in here compare to other that located in here also.

Angkringan, this place is called. Its place to eat where we are sitting under a mat, there are serving a street food, rice in small packages, have a live music from street musician. The interesting is the serving of coffee ... They using charcoal. For the taste... Its just a coffee

I came here for a light business meeting and immediately my attention was drawn to the industrial design that is different from other branches in Surabaya. I like the design and it gives combination of fine and rough style. Really love it!

The coffee is of course excellent and no accident at all. As you would have in the States or anywhere else. This is not going to give you a heart attack or tongue wash, it is the same everywhere even the prices.

The only draw back I can see it that, once you enroll into the membership, they know your name and do not play the name change game anymore. As a foreigner with an accent, they are trying very hard to make sure your name is right and becoming more serious, which for Javanese or Indonesia as a whole is understandable. I respect this.

I love Starbucks and I also notice that they seem to employee different interior designers to design each branch that makes exploration more fun and more enjoyable.

One of the best Starbucks, it's spacious, cozy, clean, the staff so friendly and helpful, we like sitting on 2 floor near big glass window to work or just chit-chat with family, we can plug in to charge our phone/laptop, we can use free wifi too, similar like in other shop in here serving good coffee and pastry, also sell merchandise and package coffee

Im very very sorry but i think starbucks nowadays are different from old days. It used to be good in old times.. But now.. not so good (standard for the drinks - and i did not buy food so i cant give any opinion for it )..

place still great to enjoy with friends. Service still good. But taste of the coffee. I think old times much better taste then now.

I think all sbux usually has same vibes, same price range. What I like about this sbux is they have two sbux and here has more spacious space, but the wifi kinda slow tho.

Open before ECC mall, however without AC.
There are two floors, which cozy. It can occupied up to 70-100 persons including the area outside the store.
AC is very cold at 2nd floor.
Menu is the same with others.
If you need electricity, find it at 2nd floor.

The atmosphere with an ancient atmosphere, equipped with antique properties throughout the cafe makes the coffee atmosphere feel like going back to the 1960s. Cozy place with delicious food.

A good taste for breakfast, not too expensive.

But you must park your car on the busy road.

Must come with motorcycle.

A very homy coffeeshop serving peranakan food, dim sum, and Malay style toasts. All foods are affordable and come with some hefty portions. The toast is wonderfully made, and the kaya jam is delicious. As you step in into the coffeeshop it feels like you turn back the time as the interior and the music slowly bring you back to 80s.

Cozy interior and extensive menu ranging from Western to Asian food. Fun place to spend the weekend with friends. If you sit indoor, the sound of the coffee machine is quite loud - so maybe it's not really comfortable for working.

Good coffee and good food sometimes always comes with the price. Nice ambience for a friendly hangout, or even a closed meeting. But mind you when you looking for this place you might can't find it right away because there's not quite obvious sign.

With regards, generally I often have to remind the waiters at cafes to not put plastic straws in my drinks.
Other great news about this cute hidden coffee shop are student friendly price ( 15k for hot or cold manual brewed coffee selection, no adding taxes and I did not see a tip box at the cashier), quiet enough to enjoy your books or do your works, or just hangout have a chit chat with friends.
Expect to come here on motorbikes, the parking spot relatively small.
Staffs were friendly, helpful, and quick witted to orders.
Its menus are simple yet efficiently made to serve, come with unique names but provide explanation below.
One down side thing was the bathroom was out of order which came with quite funny notification said can pee but not other duties.
It might or might not be a bummer, since coffees are naturally diuretic.

The black pepper was very strong, but its okay to my taste. The place was very homey. You had to make a reservation since the tables were limited.

The place is smaller than I thought, tho the decor is pretty nice. There's not that many choices of foods on the menu. Ordered some teas, panna cotta and other snacks. The lychee tea is standard, while the matcha latte is too sweet. The panna cotta is actually quite good. I appreciate them using natural ingredients for the foods. They seem to have some events for kids, there was a Halloween face paint event for kids when I came in.

Went here with my friend for brunch, it such a cozy and lovely place to visit! It was packed but the ambience was very nice and all staffs were helpful. The food was yummy, it really suits my taste.

Not the best option considering the pricing is pretty standard for similar cafes yet my drink tasted nothing like what i ordered.

This was like my 4th time here and before this my experiences were ok if not the best but this would be my last. Won't be coming back again.

Took a long time for the food to come out, no table service so we have to wait for the food downstairs. Ordered some cupped drinks and one of it wasn't sealed properly so it spilled everywhere when carried.
Someone else also took my order without the cashier noticed. Maybe they should have put numbers/names in an order so it's easy to call out the order and no one will mistakenly take other people's order.
The place itself is nice but it's crowded, and sometimes there's a selfish customer that takes table for 4 by themselves.
The menu wasn't updated, I came here for Tacos as they have it on the menu on Google Maps but when I came here, they don't have it. For Malang standard, it's quite overpriced.

wait for approximately 30 minutes and the server ended up saying the food that i ordered was out of stock. coffee milk??? should've named it MILK coffee, barely tasted any coffee.

The ambiance is something (to my architectural eyes,, hehe) love that organic meets industrialists decoration. The ceiling that combine the organic element with some of industrial yet organic lamp, also the table and chairs that fits perfectly with the entire decoration. Lit bit Bali - feels like cafe.

The minus here : there‚Äôs many ‚Äúsold out‚Äù dishes eventho I thought its not prepared at all, they just write down the dishes but they didn‚Äôt really cooked it . And the toilet is dirty, smelly. Not comfortable to use. Period! The fact that many of the beverages / refreshment they serve in a plastic bottle with glass of ice on the side. not really environmentally friendly. I m just lucky that my piccolo‚Äôs serve with espresso glass and they even make some art on it.

Their piccolo is somehow nicely present, and taste good 7.5/10. The katsu curry rice surprisingly taste nice eventho the katsu not perfectly cooked (the chicken‚Äôs too dry and we can easily separated the chicken meat with the (flour skin/ batter) they didn‚Äôt stick together LOL.

We can pay with debit card with minimum order 10k ( 2 bottles of mineral water), they not support Qris yet, I dunno why. But we can definitely pay with cash money or debit card.

The parking man is super nice to all of us, and also so kind.

Beautiful place to enjoy a sip of coffee with your friend. While chit chat, you can enjoy their cake slice or maincourse selection. Any spot is instagrammable. You must try

Ordered the Salted Caramel Latte which came in a 250ml plastic bottle by default. It was lacking in saltiness and the caffeine kick was not quite there.

Avoid coming to this place at the weekends because hardly can you find an empty seat. Most of the visitors are college students since the price is so affordable.

+ Affordable menu
+ Delicious coffee & snacks
+ Cozy for working (wifi+electrical plugs everywhere)
- the music is too damn loud
- too crowded on the weekend
- mostly you have to share tables in the communal space

Too crowded, very limited seatings. Coffee was good, their decoration and architecture as well. But one thing, i think there should be more seatings.
note: pic was taken at 12pm so it looked emptyüò™

Thanks to the humble security guard, I immediately love this cafe üôå came at Monday when it's not too crowded, the place is nice and cozy, suitable for hanging out or doing assignment as they provide quite place for co-working space, and nice playlist with appropriate volume. I thought the cookies is overpriced but no, they're so big that it takes time to finish it ü§£ The only thing they need is widen their range of menu, adding basic Americano and more non-coffee drinks will do. Overall, recommended üåü

cozy place to hangout with friends or somebody u love. good place to doing productive thing,my fav menu are es susu arang and the ice yoes too!! alwsys crowded and available in out or in door.

Good place, reasonable price. Only problem is that their playlist sucks and they play them outloud.

The price is relatively cheap (20-25K Rupiah per person). The service is good, the vibes are cool and homey. Its location is quite far from the city's center, but it's worth a visit ngl.

Kopi susu and kopi vietnam has good taste. The atmosphere of this cafe is really nice. Be ready for insects here. All staff is kind. Parking area is about 5 cars only.

It's very fresh because there are many plants and flower, it's like a garden coffe and it's instagrammable place for you.. its located in the Malang regency, surrounded by the paddy fields.
The price of the menu is achievable, you can choose this place for your dinner in the noon or in the afternoon.
But, when you order rice pack you must wait for a while because the waitress is only one so you have to be patient..
Get this place with google map direction and you can get this easily.

Carik Cenik offer a calm and chill ambience and vibes. You enjoy your drink and meals with a greeneries around you.

The menu also variant and it serves high quality beverages.

For you that loves planting and green decorations, this place also sell lots of greeneries variants.

The place is quite spacious but the lack of air conditioner make it seems stuffy, despite the good architecture and design. Provide various kind of food with affordable price, a bit expensive for Klaten area tho. The food taste just ok. Sometimes it takes long time to wait for the food to be serve. The gelato is just ok.

Came here with my family at night, this place was not very crowded and has relaxing ambience. Nice semi-outdoor rooftop dining with a bit of gardenic nuance, but no sightseeing here. Their gelato is so good, reasonably priced and has quite a lot flavors. Unfortunately, the food we had was too salty.

They're really serving extra delicious foods!

It's kind of restaurant that served many kinds of food, like Chinesse, Italian or European foods, you can also find gellato here.
The price ? I think it's beyond average compared to many other restaurants in Klaten. But for me, it doesn't matter, since the food and drinks tastes really good, nice ambience and  with a good spatial planning. ^_^"

Cafes in Surabaya taste like International cafe. a very unique cafe concept, a combination of teddy bear decorations, very Instagram able. Perfect for family gatherings with very affordable and delicious menu prices.

Cafe should be like a cafe. It's more like a photo studio. they haven't many tables and you were not allowed to take the pictures as the sign shows on the entrance window. We took it anyway lol üòà
It's weird as we came for the interior and decorations as it said unique so, why not allowed to take any pictures? They should write it on their information. Well, except the teddy bears others just wallpapers.
We felt really disappointed as we came from Jakarta to see it while we had a holiday in Surabaya.
We ordered ice lychee tea and banana split ice cream to comfort our disappointed feeling.
So, I would say ""Big NO""
Safe your money and time for other places

The ability to book the whole place for one family is great in these times. Cute settings with lots of bears and lights. Food is good. Quite an enjoyable private dinner time with family.

There must be >8 angkringan vendors in this space. The space is quite big, so no worries to get a seat.

Menu is about the same from 1 vendor to another, just choose which one you feel drawn to.

Angkringan food usually consist of:
‚Ä¢ nasi bungkus (packed rice in smaller portion)
‚Ä¢ indomie (best instant noodle in the world)
‚Ä¢ sundukan (meat on skewers)
‚Ä¢ wedhang (hot drink like coffee, tea, ginger)

I didn't have much time, so only had some sundukan.

I must say that the KAI did the whole space really nicely. There's even locker & shower amenities in the stretch of Slasar Malioboro.

Craving for wedang ronde so I decided to visit this place.

Great for your diet. I lost five kilos in one night. I recommend a Homestay with your own bathroom ;)

This place is serving one of the most favorite coffee in Jogja, for everyone near this area, I would personally recommend to try Kopi Joss. It's unique and a special coffee, hot coal was added. Affordable and worth it.

It's an excellent place to bring friends, lesehan or sit on chairs are options. The services are nice. Recommended!

One of the street boba outlets on the most iconic street in Surabaya, Jalan Tunjungan

The interior uses an industrialist concept where at some points it uses an unpainted cement facade which makes the minimalist concept very strong

Apart from that right next to it there is a Gildak outlet which uses an eye-catching interior concept that strong korean pop ambiance combines and makes both of them Instagrammable

Payment:
Cash, Debit, QR

This place is really clean and cute. It also follows the current health protocol quite well. I would recommend going here with your friends or family as it is instagramable-friendly and would be great as a hangout spot for youths and alike.

If you are to come here, I would recommend coming during mid-day as it is not so crowded at that time.

As for the price range, I would say it is mediumly price for its size. The small one is actually bigger than I expected and would I say it's worth it? It depends. The flavor of the drink I had was mediocre at best and was decently price for it. I don't regret it as I finished it in a single sitting.

In conclusion, a great hangout spot if you're in the area but just be prepared to spend a good amount of money for a drink that taste vaguely like something you've had before.

A new boba place in Surabaya. Location is so close to hotel Majapahit and Tunjungan Plaza (walking distance). There are indoor (quite big) and outdoor seating areas. Inside is so instagram worthy üòÅ Price of its boba is around IDR 24K. Not only drinks, it also serves donuts which cost around IDR 8000/ pc.

Really good bubble tea, the boba are chewy and tasty, the popping boba is also really delicious. None of that halfway cooked boba at all. Recommended!

The place is cute, located in old town of surabaya. In front of historical hotel. Suitable for hangout. You can have good drink with cute snack because it's together with gildak. My fave is tokyo locama and nambai kawaipon"

One of great coffee shop in town. They have good taste of coffee. They also serve many varians of food and drink, coffee and non coffee are just as good.
The barista is friendly and pleasing.
They have two floors, large room, many books. But parking area is not really  spacious and I suggest to taking care more to the cleanness of toilet.
Overall, everything is satisfying there

Cozy place to enjoy your coffee and spend your time with your loved ones.The food and beverages here are yummy!

This coffee shop is a brilliant idea. It combines a coffee shop and a library into one. This place is very suitable for studying, doing assignments, or just reading. There is a free wifi for customers. There are many books that can be read here, customers can also buy them. The coffee are vary with various methods. There are also ice-blend, chocolate based drinks, some variant of tea, soda-based (squash) drinks, and snacks. The prices are reasonable. There is a toilet, it is clean.

It is a place decorated like a library with a lot of collections of books around. You can read them if you want tho. Not crowded outside, far enough from the main road to not bothered with the noise.
The beverages are fancy, and the snacks are plenty, all come with considerable prices.

Overall it's a good place to hang out with friends and colleagues"

For the place so warm and cozy, i mean you feel like in your own house (they used literally a house to open this coffee shop). It‚Äôs so comfortable, they separate smoking area and non smoking area by inside and outside (inside is non-smoking area and outside is smoking area) i ended smoking at non-smoking area bcs there‚Äôs no sign about it (sorry) but the employee just nicely inform ke about it, so no damage done
And let‚Äôs talk about toilet of this place, it‚Äôs VERY HUGE hahaha and clean.

A quite cozy place to have a talk and a cup of coffee. They have some good mac and cheese. The interior design is pleasing too. Friendly baristas and nice hospitality. Wanna come here again for sure.

Homies mood, nice coffee , nice snack and humble service like we have been met before. üòä

Nice ambience and atmosphere. Pretty cozy for groups and great for taking photos because it has a nice interior. Menu is little pricey and still a few choices offered by this cafe. The taste is just okay. Located near the junior high school 1. Easy to spot and plenty parking areas.

Nice place, cozy enough. They have little backyard. The coffee was good. But the spaghetti is slightly oily (so sorry)."

The air-conditioned room is on the first floor, for smokers it can be on the second floor and the rooftop. Has a variety of menus. It tastes good, the price is affordable. Friendly service. There is a helmet storage area.

We stopped here before attending the reception of friends. The place is nice, located next to optik Melawai and also owned by the same person. The barista and staff are friendly and informative. The drinks was good (we ordered lychee tea and cold brewed coffee). The price is reasonable yet still cheap (less than 20k each). So, we‚Äôre happy.

The food is really good in here. I didn't try the coffee, so I am not sure about the taste of coffee in here. Too many university students, so sometimes they were very loud. But it's okay, it's normal. Just 1 thing, this place should improve the circulation of the air.
Too many people smoking at the smoking area and you can smell it until the non smoking area because the bad circulation.

I bought red velvet and cappuchino, cappuchino is fine, but the red velvet was terrible. It didn't mixed well, and tasted mediocre, too sweet and it's not filled up the glass.

Good concept, nice coffee, industrial concept coffee shop with some food, price is reasonable. They have coworking space style desk at 2nd floor but not much power outlet... you can smoking in indoor area..."

+ specialty in Taiwan dessert
+ MUST TRY THEIR BINGSOO, Any flavor, it is soooo perfect
+ I like the concept
+ strategic location
+ indoor and outdoor available
+ MUST TRY APPLE CRUMBLE PUDDING
+ their snacks also delicious üòã
+ my favorite dessert bar in Town!
- small place
- toilet is too small
- limited parking spot
- no big signage in front, so you need to look carefully

Best bingsoo i‚Äôve ever tasted! My favorite one will always be their strawberry cheesecake bingsoo. Cost around 40k rupiah to get this bowl of sweetness which can be eaten by 1-2 person. Make sure to pick the right time to come here, because usually they‚Äôre full and there‚Äôs a waiting list (especially on the weekend).

Super ecstatic to have an authentic bingsoo place in Malang. I mean the bingsoo that usually being sold in my hometown usually the cheap version. But Timtong elevated it close to the actual bingsoo supposed to be.

It was delicious, the ice shaved is so soft and creamy because it was made from creamy milk and processed using the real bingsoo machine. The red bean on my Azuki Matcha is also royal. I mean they gave me lots of it so it is guaranteed you‚Äôre gonna be satisfied to have one bowl of shared bingsoo here.

The single serving is actually for 2 portion and the sharing serving can be enjoyed by 3-4 person. The price is affordable. Place is comfy but too small and often had long queue. The sweetener is using honey. Anyway they also sell refreshing drinks and tea which are also hard to miss.

I will definitely go back here and recommend this place despite its well-known association with the Masterchef winner üëÄ

Authentic bingsoo place in Malang. Too crowded and waiting list for takeaway or dine in.  the price a little bit pricey, but the taste is 7/10. Try the pudding is good."

I had just arrived at the cafe when suddenly it rained hard. The roof made of some.kind of metal couldn't handle the noisy mess so I couldn't hear a word my friend said to me. Meanwhile, the latte I ordered tasted plain. It tasted like it had too much water. Sorry for the bad review.

Standard low budget caffe, be carefull if you go to this caffe when rain because some roof has a leak. The menu are not too diverse, price range for drink start from 8k-17k, there is french fries, chicken nugget, dan sausage 15k, for doughnut 5k/piece, sometimes you should pay parking sometimes no, its depend on situation

It is a good place near Batu City, the food is also good for several foods...
The ambience is great, but the parking is limited...

a unique cafe with a tropical theme in a mountainous area, the menu offered is varied, the price is very cheap with a very good taste. suitable for hangout and chit chat with others and for family. Recommended!

Lacoco Cafe is conveniently situated and easy to find. Ambiance and the greek decorative approach are very nice and well thought off.
Taste of food and drinks are nice. Moderate on the price range.  Note: The Coffee Klepon is nice (pic attached)
If you are looking for an instagramable place this is one of those establishment, pull out your camera and make great pics here :)
Best to ride a motorcycle or hail a ride if you want to come here because looking for a parking spot will be hard especially during meal times

nice cafe for taking photos/selfies. its a good place cause the vibes are outdoor even if its looked like an indoor cafe.

the foods and drinks are affordable and tasty, i would come again with my friends and family just for the food and the vibes."

Best coffee shop to study, work, doing your thesis. They have smoking and non smoking area, but i prefer the non smoking one. Love their playlist, not too crowded and looove their selection of beans and filtered coffee, their iced latte and green tea are also a good option!

Good atmosphere and very comfortable. Lots of charging station available, both inside and outside. Great coffee, but not so much option available, the price is standard. If you are looking for a place to do your work I recommend this place

I love the vanilla mint tea for drink and tahu telor pedas for food. I dont recommend the dim sums though.

The one star off is because sometime there is loud low quality music played in background.

it's just a small good coffe shop with hospitality touch at the corner of center Sukarno Hatta road where youth people spending their time or gathering. I think it a nice place for chatting.

If your community wants to hold a meeting, this is a good place to book. They provide free lcd projector upstairs.

I went to this place because I got together with my friends with scholarships from UIN, UM, and UB to discuss work programs. Here not only serves various kinds of drinks and snacks but also facilitates reading books, visitors who come can spend their time enjoying the meal while reading the books that are neatly arranged on the shelves. In my opinion, the service is pretty good, the taste of the drinks is also pretty good, and the prices are also right from 8 thousand to 20 thousand, it's just that in my opinion the place is not comfortable. The chairs were not neatly arranged after being occupied by other people and the table still had traces of the drink from the previous visitor.

This coffee shop is so well-known arround the students in Malang because this place's included as the most productive coffee shops for discussion and another agendas. It's also commonly called as Gusdurian (a group of people who follow the value of Gus Dur, 4th President of Indonesia) basecamp and also the place for meeting and discussion by another communities tho. There are many books in the first floor, and it's actually has 3 floors. This place is not only sold the coffee, but also tea, milk, hot chocolate and so on.

this place live up to its name. it provides light drinks, coffee, and small snacks. there's a decent public library, means you don't need to worry if you forgot to bring your books. wifi are also available if you're in for some productivity tasks. parking is not shaded and it's on the side of the street directly. may not suitable for dating, but best for group discussion.

EDIT: several days ago I went back and found out if you want to do events here you need to secure mininum purchase of several hundred thousand rupiahs. If you cannot do that, they charge you additional money. But not all the menus are available for us to purchase. Most of them are sold out, but they don't care if we couldn't reach the mark, we still need to pay the money. How could we fulfill their minimum purchase, if we cannot order anything? I lowered my points from 4 to 2. Still a good place, but not recommended for meeting.

I went here for a casual meeting with my friend. They ran out of the snack and meals. I could ordered iced taro only. The price was cheap. I was surprised the photo in the Google maps didn't match the reality. The place was kinda dirty. They might haven't mopped the floor for a really long time. There were thick layer of dust above the books on the shelf. I was having my drink in the rooftop. The rooftop was dirty and kinda dark. There were only one or two light bulbs. The toilet was in the second story, it was really smelly and disgusting. Poorly maintained place.

It's really nice to hang out here actually, especially if you host a discussion event or simply want to meet people and talk upon some issues in depth. For this oase cafe regulars are activists and intellectuals.

I was hosting a discussion event inviting some groups several days ago. The management charges us 210k rupiah for minimum purchase.

What really disappoint me is:
1) they didnt explain that there will be minimum purchase before the d-day
2) I was and am really okay with the minimum purchase, it's small amount of money. I was really sure the crowd will exceed the minimum purchase by ordering several drinks and food. BUT THEY ONLY SERVED DRINKS. THE MEALS ON THEIR MENU WERE NOT AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT YET THEY STILL INSIST FOR US MAKING IT TO MINIMUM PURCHASE
(how could you expect your customer to order a bag of air or a plate of disappointment and inconvenient and swearing never come back there again smh)
3) They even didn't let us start our event until we make it to minimum purchase. I do understand that your company pushed you hard to meet our obligation as client, sir. But please: you should have informed me before the d-day and providing solving to the situation too!
4) I was complaining to the management after the event finished, they told me that IF I DIDNT MAKE THE MINIMUM PURCHASE, I HAD TO GIVE THEM THE SPARE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CHARGED US.
Excuse you, sir, but your company fail to cater us the food you promised to serve. And you expect us to get our money for bags of air and plates of disappointment. Thank you.
5) We did make it to the minimum purchase. Although I had to pay for some orders they served wrong.

It is never about the amount of money for me. It is the hospitality this caf√© fail to provide. I have charged for bigger amounts of money at another caf√© and I was really happy. Definitely will not come back."

2nd floor is nicely set..
But the 1st floor is very dull, and the garden isn't exactly a garden, it's just a pavement, facing the garden of a private house ( the owner's house is my guess).

This place can be crowded, especially on the weekend.
Queuing can take a long time..because the only menu is available next to the only cashier, so it takes a lot time just for a customer to pick and pay for their menu. Adding a menu board at the entrance will help cutting the queue time.

Tried the siomay and plain roti maryam. Price is pretty cheap, suitable for young people. But the taste is just average for roti maryam. As for the siomay, for me it taste like a frozen food.

As for the drink, we ordered 3 kinds of milkshake.. vanilla, royal chocolate and choco hazelnut, all are very thin to my taste..too much water..

Waiters need a lot of training communication skill..

A comfortable place with a charming view, but not many menus are available and should add more variants

I ordered their Pot Ayam Kungpao and the amount of chicken dices surprised me. It was a lot. And it tastes great actually. Yet, the star was the butter coffee. It was my first time drinking such a unique and calming coffee. They added some butter into the coffee and when they're blended, it gave some sweet creamy kinda taste. I love it!

Beware of the queue as it gets so long on weekend. Pricewise is cheap as the portion is big. The main dish served at 09.00 but it opens at 07.00 so if you come before 09.00 you have to wait for the dish to be served. Really love the rice pot because i think it only sold here. The kungpao is dominant with sweet taste but really great. I recommend you all to order the milo tarik cause its super great üëçüèª

nice ambicence, like singaporean kopitiam in 80's

Good coffee and teh tarik

Must try the claypot rice, savory and tasty
and kaya toast, the sweetness is just right.

Beware of the crowds every weekend morning.

I don‚Äôt usually give 3 stars rating but i hope this served as a feedback to improve. Was honestly liking the whole ambience of old chinatown neighborhood because it just felt so nice & very down to earth. What gives me not so pleasant is it took too long to serve when there‚Äôs no queue. Ordered butter coffee & somehow it‚Äôs fine just not really my liking. Also ordered kungpao chicken which tastes okay (which for me i think you could do better to make it taste more like kungpao chicken), and the last is mie kwa which I don‚Äôt really fond of‚Ä¶. It just tastes wrong. The noodles are okay, it‚Äôs ordinary but the soup is just ??? I‚Äôm losing the concept of the taste because it‚Äôs herb-y, with the wrong kind of bitter taste in it. I hope you could improve the taste somehow and take this feedback because the place has a good potential !

The ambience is like ""tempo doeloe""
It is really crowded in the weekend, you should come on the weekdays if you don't like to queue

Yep, definitely will never coming back.

coffee shop with a view of the train tracks. in my opinion the price is relatively expensive when compared to the taste served.

The taste was okay. But i dont think it's worth the price, cause the portion was small.
They have indoor and outdoor setting. But the indoor was to dark and gloomy. The only good thing was the outdoor (cause you can see the train), but you will absolutely can't use it if it were raining outside.
They played the music out loud to the point of annoying. I spend time to work there, and have a meeting. But they didn't even bother to decrease the volume.
And don't forget the music wasn't suite the cafe vibes.
And also lots of mosquito, if you stay there past 5pm.

Hope the cafe improve its quality, vibes and service.

Nice place for alone or family.
The right place for bring the kid to see train. Lovely vibes.

We found this place by coincidence on a Saturday about 8pm and we found it pretty comfy,  they have an extended good menu and beer. About 100 meters from the Malang Train station. Friendly servers; they speak English and the menu is in English (not that correct English but understandable). We also have some snacks and they were delicious. Prices aren't as expensive as a fancy hotel nearby, but not as cheap as local prices either, resonable prices.

I was interested to visit this place for I saw plenty parking customers' motorcycles by the fence every time I pass it. Unfortunately what I got on visit was opposite to inviting.

Arriving at this place, this place was pretty empty. It was around 2 in the afternoon. The room design was simple....it is more like dull square chairs and rectangular brown tables. Definitely nothing about its atmosphere attracts people to come. The street at its front was noisy and it is a huge oven with metal roof, ready to bake anyone. Probably it is so since there is no tree around it.

The coffee was actually fine yet it does nothing to reduce the inconveniences. The perfect disaster brought by its french fries. It was served on a plate of 20 cm of diameter and looked slightly wet. When I touched it was really damp, seemed like soaked in cooking oil rather fried. And thanks to the fries bland taste, my disappointment was complete.

I still do not understand the reason people coming back to this place.

6 times visiting never had a chance to take the pictures of my meals, my mouth works faster.

I recommend you to try the KAMBING JOKAN and the jumbo tea tarik

Best for family, couple, and hangout

The lambs are tasty! Have tried most of the lamb menu, all of them are recommended. Good service and right price. Must try!

The place to go for fresh fruits, especially bananas.. loads of them..

A great traditiobal market where you can buy variety of fruits and kitchen utensils for a fair price.

The cool weather of Tretes makes it so comfortable to shop here.

Visiting this market is one of the activities we always do whenever we visit Tretes.

Traditional market.. Sell fruit, snack and souvenir. Cheap price

It is a very interesting place. In the evening there will be many food stall selling their simple food such as satay, ronde, angsle, bakso, fried rice etc. The atmosphere is festive and the air is cool. The market that starts from morning, sells simple houseware, a variety of vegetables and fruit. The price is relatively cheap. Worth to visit especially at night."

The menus are pricey but fine. They have the best healthy (smoothies) bowls, the ingredients are fresh and well-presented.

Overall taste, ambiance, service, and price is great. Would recommend the Bao Wow, although you must be careful while eating it, it could be messy. Service was amazing and quick, server was kind and helpful. Price for 3 piece bow wow was 50k I guess that‚Äôs normal. Parking spot was available. The ambiance were spot on, calming, with lots of greenery.

Good place to hangout with your pet, they allowed to bring them in

Ordered nasi goreng bali (forgot to take the pic) portion is good but a bit over priced

the staff is friendly, but somehow feel so pricey here,
the drink is a bit disappointing, as ordered a jar but its the size of 3 little cup actually

the taste is good, a little expensive but the portion given is quite large, the service from the waiter can be improved, the waiter looks passive and doesn't smile. 4 stars for taste 2 stars for service 3 stars for price. Food prices range from IDR 52.5 (Balinese fried rice) - 147.5 before tax & service charge. Drinks start from IDR 16

Overall I like this place. Even though today the air con not too cold. Maybe they reduce due to pandemic. Food are tasty."

As a non coffee lover. The butter coffee is not bitter and tasted good. The fried noodle is decent. A bit too sweet for my preferences. Crowded and smoking area but overall good

Best kopitiam in malang town so far
I have tried some kind of places in malang, and i found that this place is the best overall
I like the butter coffee, not to sweet not to strong
I like the kaya butter toast too. It is a perfect combination.
I ordered the other food too, and all was good. The price is really affordable.
But, there is not enough chair and table. You have to queue for about 10-20 minutes. N.b i came at 10 am
Definitely will come back next time

oldschool kopitiam that everyone would love! it's located near train station, so we made a short visit to takeaway some food to be enjoyed in train. overall it tasted good with affordable price

If you like retro places, you must try this coffee shop. The vibes of this place is like 80s Singaporean coffee shops, who served Coffee, Milk Tea, Bread, and Half-boiled Egg. The coffees are great, their must try are the Butter Coffee and Coffee with Evaporated Milk. But if you like the classic, their Classic Black Coffee is a bomb. Also the Kaya Butter Bread! Sweetness from the Kaya jam and the saltiness of the butter mixed very well, it's delicious! Their menu is not too much, just a bit snacks like Cireng, Mendoan and Ngo Hiong (this one, very recommended!!), also the main course, like Fried Bakmee (a bit too sweet for me, but still delish!) and Soup Bakmee. Also the ambience, it's very cozy and calm, you'll want to spend hours here if you love the old city vibes. Definitely gonna come back if I visit Malang again!"

Put it in your go to cafe repertoir

It was a good place to kill the time with your mates. The place is quite easy to reach and also comfortable to chill or doing some work. The menu is interesting because you'll find different variant of coffee that rarely served at another coffee shop in malang like salted caramel coffee and also caramel macchiato which as far I know I can only find it at starbucks coffee. The minus is the lighting at night that just not the same the indoor and outdoor area, thats just look not so good. And also the concept of the indoor area was so so, I mean not really special. But over all the caramel macchiato was good :')

I tried their latte and it was real good. It was served in a cute cup, without a teaspoon (as other cafes would do). But I enjoyed it much. Also, their 'cireng bumbu rujak' is refreshing!

Good place with homey vibe and of course the Cappuccino is great for me with such price.

Nice little coffee shops, ample outdoor space, decent power outlets, good selection of beverage. The baristas were kind and polite (just make sure to ask them if there is any requests about your order, they'll be happy to help you or you just want to chit chat with them). The only downside is, there isn't any decent parking space (you must park your vehicle beside the road, and the road just too damn narrow). 3/5 (-2 points for the availability of the parking space.

The decoration theme's interesting.

We ordered mendoan and chicken rice. For the drinks we chose the iced coffee and iced yuja tea. The yuja tea portion is a bit small, but it served beautifully.

The mendoan tasted bland, so it needed to be dipped into the sauce. It'd be good to add salt a little. However the portions were a lot, which perfect for hangout snacks.

For the chicken rice, it tasted fine. I tried it a bite and I liked it.

The place is overall good, but there were mosquitos in the indoor seating. Maybe because we came there at late afternoon.

The staff gave survey form to be fill out. That's good for their improvement.

Excellent place to hang out and not too crowd, they have some board games you can borrow wjile you were waiting for your dishes. The special chicken menu is very nice and worth the price. Fried banana is meh but the waffle is good (nice combination with the sweet ice cream).

You can choose between the building, rooftop or garden area. Tbh i enjot the atmosphere even there are some problem with the cats (not really mind it but i cant eat very peacefully haha). They also have a live music session until 9.45 pm.

Kancane's yuzu ice tea is delicious and very fresh, highly recommend. Jogja does not lack cool places to hang out  each offers its specialty.

The choice this time is to try hanging out in kancane. From a friend's recommendation, he said this place offers good tea. Check google map, see the review, then cuss! curious. it's not difficult to find a place (you just have to follow the google map and it's ok)

I already think this place is going to be really cool, by the time I reach their patking space. When you enter the room you are greeted with vintage style, You see chairs with colorful nets plus old school tables, combined with a cool modern bar too.

Ordered their special tea, immediately ordered yuzu ice tea (Jogja happened to be a bit hot at that time) and a snack platter for snacking while working on projects and online meetings.

When I sip its Yuzu Ice Tea, it makes me feel fresh like that. It feels really good, very refreshing! Green tea blends with yuzu oranges so it's sweet, fresh, really delicious. Just add it right away, don't wait for it to run out!

For those who are in Jogja or on vacation to Jogja, you have to go to Kancane, not far from Hyatt Monjali anyway. The parking lot is also very wide.

Everything are perfect for this cafe. Actually, it's more like a co-working space than a cafe. Every spots has their own themes with their own multiple electric sockets. The vibes are just cozy to open your laptops. Or hangout with friends and play scrabble. The food was ok. The drinks was great. The outdoor space was spacious and shady with many trees. The location itself has several co-working spaces too.

cozy and spacious place with humble staff they help us to take good pictures. Nice for hangout, and meetings."

Not worth the money, the food is pricey while the taste is not that good, chicken cordon blue (69k) the chicken was dry, the sauce is tasteless, and just a regular potatoes fries; tamie (65k) was ok

I think Artap has a unique concept with artificial plants. So you can feel nature (outdoors) and indoors at the same time. Super comfy to spend time with family or friends. Available many foods and drinks variant also serving food with great looks

The atmosphere is great. What I like the most about this place is it has books to read and various handcrafts and art to display and sell. I think it's a nice move. This place is so artsy, beautiful and cozy place to hang out and have quality time with loved ones.  But this restaurant needs to improve the taste of their foods. üòÅ

One of the new coffee shop in town. Probably will be my favorite now, since the place has very cozy ambiance to hangout and chilling with friends. The coffee is tasty, i tried the salty caramel one and i like it, didn't try the pizza and snacks next time will definitely try them!
Many Instagramable spots inside, I really love how they put many green trees inside and make it super beautiful and eco friendly. Fantastic! Most of the area are for smoking area, yet they also provide non-smoking room with air conditioner, from there I can feel comfy seat and good desk to work, wifi speed is acceptable.
They also have this facilities for customers, such as: large parking lots (paid), prayer room, clean toilets, faucet to wash hands (covid19 health protocol), and live music in the evening!
I really recommend the place to hangout with your friends and mingle with family here, however for digital nomad who wants to work (like me) or student who wants to do assignments here, maybe the place won't suit you because this is not coworking space as they claimed. Yet, if you want to do it here, i suggest you to do it in non-smoking room with AC.
Overall great coffee shop!!

Great! Delicious pizza, great coffee and convenient. Perfect if you want to meet up with your client or friend, even with family. Worth to try!

Good food, good drinks, reasonable price. The music played at the background are terrible (not the live music tho) They should compose their own music playlist, with such theme, such as 90s song, easy listening or slow rock, not just random singer/music on spotify.

Price is okay, taste is not bad at all.
The wifi here works fine, but not the best. If you meed super fast wifi, then this place is not reliable. Yet, its good place to go for coffee in the morning since they open very early at 7AM.
The only thing is that they don't have much parking side, it is located on the side of the main road so only can have one car parked and not many bikes too. Hope they will consider more parking lots.

The design interior is nice. The aircon is on and sufficient so it's quite cold and good inside. However, the coffee is so-so. I ordered Caramel Latte and Caramel Macchiato. The Macchiato one tasted quite strange since the milk was not that good.

Place is recommended for a meeting or work alone. Foods that served not the best but still ok even i have to say bit pricey..not meet with my expectations when i first see the price.

#bossmanreviews

my fav cafe in Ciworld due to their menu is familiar in my son's taste. He's really likes Bakmi Goreng. And their croffle menu was great too! And their menu's plating was great as well ... keep it up!

Ordered this ""happy cup"" via gojek. The taste is very good with a very affordable price, only around 22k to 26k per portion.  Comes in a quite big portion too. They only do ""happy cup"" for gojek only not for dine in. I love the dory sambal matah, the sambal matah tasted fresh. I love that they put the sauce and pickles in a separate plastic so the chicken will not get soggy from the sauce.

Delicious food, great service. There are smoking area inside. So this place is also comfortable for non smoking person. They also have a plethora beverage, which is also delicious. I tried teh tarik and i recommend it to try.

The place is really cosy and well decorated, pretty original. The waiters were quite friendly and did not hesitate to ask their colleague when they didn't know the answer to some of our questions. The prices of the meals are high for Indonesia, but normal inside such big mall. Their meals have different origins, indonesian, japanese, european... there is a good variety. The meals we ordered were all tasty and the portions big enough. We recommend this place, for a meal or just for a drink!! :-)"

+ Love the color palette of this cafe
+ The bar is so cute
+ Love the Wastafel area
+ Indoor and outdoor
+ Cute concept
- Limited parking lot
- Their food is not quite tasty
- Some furniture finishing is ugly

I came here when this coffe shop just open about a week, so during my visit this cafe always busy. I like their concept about recycling old house into new cafe, without break down the house.
Love their outdoor ceiling, because they use clear ceiling.

A coffee shop that has a unique concept in Malang is different from other coffee shops. It gets an 8/10 for ambiance because it's cute and unique. There are also quite a lot of seats provided, but the place is not too wide for a coffee shop because it is located in a residential area. It looks like this coffee shop is only suitable for chatting with friends and not for doing assignments because the place is quite noisy and crowded, so it's not comfortable if you need a place that's not noisy. For food and drink, I give a rating of 9/10 because it is delicious and unique, and the price is cheap. Various kinds of drinks and food are provided here. From snacks to heavy meals, and in my opinion, all the menus don't fail because they match their appearance with what is on the menu. Service 8.5/10 due to self-service drinks and food delivered by the waitress. Besides that, for those of you who like to take pictures here, a photobox is provided. for which, of course a separate fee is charged.

I do like this cafe! Small, but so comfort! I can say that I will be enjoy and no boring to spend a half day here! The food and drinks are so good!
‚ùóÔ∏èplease attention ‚ùóÔ∏è it will be super good if u can provide the customers with musholla! So sad, there is no musholla there."

Nice dishes (i tried a few, but forgot to take some photos), good drinks, and serve a 'right' gelato. Why it's right? Because people get confused between gelato and ice cream. And this shop has the right amount of sugar. Not overly sweet. I've tried their NY cheesecake flavor, ferrero rocher, wild strawberry, rhum raisins. They are all good and have nice texture. Their salad portion is quite generous to share. Black ink squid pasta, korean chicken wings, fried rice, kecombrang rice with grilled prawns, even their Corn Fritters are good. They serve nice coffee also. Not the best, but I consider it's good.

Best concept cafe and restaurant in Pekalongan for hangout, lunch and dining. They serves many type of gelato ice cream too. Free WIFI available. Serving time is quite fast around 5-15 minutes, quick and agile waiter/waitress. My favourite snack is korean chicken wings. Searing capacity is very large, around 120 seating. Parking area for 8 car and many motorbike. They have FREE valet service too. They have an outdoor area for smoking and chill. Afterglam lash & nail is behind arto cafe & gelato. A must to visit cafe in pekalongan

Very convenient and spotless resto in Pekalongan city offers coffee, gelato, and various of meals. Seafood spaghetti tomyum is so tasty in this resto

Best cafe in town! Servicenya memuaskan, the place is so cozy, tersedia juga afterglam lash and nail

The best place for meeting with clients as enjoying food n drinks in Pekalongan. Gelatos, juices, V60 coffee, light menus and steaks are good !"

Beli menu kopi di pagi hari free donat. Must try sarsaparila, caramel machiato, enoki crispy.

Honestly their interior is a bit off. Their menus are okay but please, if you're in a small indoor place don't put your music volume too loud! Your customers will not get comfy and ended up not buying more of your menus!

the place is comfy. a good place for u, instagram-slave haha. pricey, at least for me. love the toilet. clean. the 2nd floor is to die for. they provide tables with sofas and live music on the 2nd floor. u can also see the night street through the balcony. the food is good. definitely a place for u to hang out

My personal favorite coffee shop in Malang.
The food and drinks I‚Äôve ordered always taste right on my buds.

I fell in love with the place thanks to the sofas area on the 2nd floor. They look a lot like a family restaurant in the west lol! It‚Äôs cute and private. The WiFi is fast and consistent, so you definitely can study, work, or just enjoy your netflix comfortably. I always visited the place in the morning till afternoon so far, and it‚Äôs never been too crowded. Perhaps because I haven‚Äôt stop by at its peak hour.

They accept ovo as well which is good.

It's a two-story cafe so the place is quite spacious. The theme for the 1st and 2nd floor is different, the 1st floor interior looks like a common yet comfy interior you'd find in any typical cafe. The 2nd floor looks like a family dinner place, the other section looks like casual-colorful themed, the terrace is woody-themed [?]

Their drink tastes alright and the pricing is no different than other caf√©s (around IDR 20K and up). We bought a toast and mozzarella stick, hmm... the taste and presentation can be improved.

There's a lot of seating arranged for small to large group. We went there around 8 PM and sat on the 2nd floor terrace. I tell you it's not the best place to enjoy the night. Although the cafe itself located in a strategic place with good parking space, the road is way too busy and noisy for you to hold a proper conversation without raising your voice. Even though the 1st floor music sounds a bit louder, I suppose it's better that way because you'd hear less noise from the busy road."

It‚Äôs a nice place to chill while enjoying the golf view. While the food is not the most delicious or affordable, I‚Äôll still return for some quality coffee.

Like their now defunct 2 locations, this place serves really below standard chicked pop and mediocre fried rice. I love chickens, and they managed to do wrong on all of the chicken dishes they recommended.

I would totally skip their rice dishes and food altogether and just order their slightly better croissants. Their iced coffee used to taste good, but now its just a regular coffee shop that no longer has any ""i want that coffee"". I came here several times, and each time i was annoyed by their bad servers. May it be their senior servers or interns, they were all as bad.

Food 1.5*/5*

Almost all tasted good, not your standard tasting cafe menu, but the menu not much to choose. Calamari has shrivelled, so it's small and tough. Egg benedict not enough sauce and tasted little bland, the bread was dry.

Location is #1. With a golf view, everything taste better.

Expect the similar quality as CG Jakarta. Same beans, same standard. Slightly different food offerings, as they have Krui, Surabaya‚Äôs own cake / pastry shop.

Love it. If not for the smokers outside would‚Äôve given a five stars. Haha

Nice place and good scenery to the golf course.

Food and beverage is standard, not too pricy (10-20k if i remembered). French fries is too crisp (i think it's should be crisp on the outside, soft on the inside). I suggest the menu should be more varies, especially for the food, i think should have some main course.

There's board game that you can play (like uno and domino), wifi, and power outlet.

Overall it's great, if you want spending time with your collagues or having a place for group work, this is it.

A simple, elegant and wonderful cafe serving a large number of hot and cold drinks and fast food. Located in Dao, Malang, East Java on the sub-highway.

Good place, suitable for meeting, live music everyday

It's good cafe but the variety of foods and drinks sometimes are empty

My experience so far has been great. Comfy place, amazing customer service, as well as delicious and variable drinks and food to choose from the menu.

Highly recommend their Cappuccino, Latte, Salted Caramel Latte and Coklat Kopi.

Great ambience with calm playlist. Good place to do chit chat because its not too loud. Helpful and nice baristas. Point plus: they use contactless menu by using tablet (?) to choose the menu. But compared to its size, the price is a little bit pricey.

So so happy to have find this little gem in my trip to Indonesia.
Highly recommended

It is a cozy place to chill, outdoor seating, power outlet you can get some work done here. But it is somewhat hot in the afternoon.

The food is nice and the drink is pretty good. Be mindful that traffic noise may be a little loud.

a spacious place to grab some snack and afternoon tea. cakes are various, includes traditional ones. taste are worth the price. should be live music show if it weren't for this cov19 situation. not much option for main course, but then again, it is a cake store!

This place is an alternative for you who bored with modern cafe/coffeeshop. Cake Shop Sara has an old-school classic vibes. The foods, cakes, and ice cream, are all delicious, the taste is really original and once you taste the ice cream, you'll remember your old days or the taste of the ice cream that your parents like. The place itself is also really cozy and homey.

Great Coffee,  I should mention it first!  Warm and authentic place, good lighting, comfort atmosphere, Great fried rice and broccoli  crispy taste. There quite a lots side dish.

I love this place. Their coffee is quite good and they can make anything coffee based. I still prefer single origin tho, but their white is also great. Fingerfoods are average but when you got coffee, you can never fail with fried banana.

The price is very affordable and it has spacy room for your friends, families, or your partner.

I suggest to go here in the afternoon as they don't have room with air conditioner, and all areas are smoking areas, so think twice before you bring your baby here. (Who will bring baby for a coffee tho)

I've been here, and I'd love this place. Vintage place. Prices? Not too expensive. Outdoor and indoor. Good for hangouts with your friends and couples. Novels available at there you can read it (if you're book worm). And of course WiFi available üòÇ

- if you're craving for something sweet, try their jagung bakar or roti bakar

Nice corn and toast (roti bakar). Roti bakar recommended. Stmj also nice.

Taste is so so and loads of the menu are gone at only 10.30pm.. that's bad for STMJ..

Hello Coffee lover

This is a place you have to visit, why?

1. the place is very cozy
2. good drink of course
3. good coffee
4. an okay price for a cafe in the middle of the city

If I feel good in the morning here, it's not too crowded.  Can do assignments or can think of work or can also think of something else.

The minus is the lack of parking especially for those who bring a car.
But there is a solution, you just have to go-taxi online

Enjoy yes

The interior is superb. It's cozy and warm. I prefer the indoors because the outdoors have too many mosquitos.

They have quite a variety of menus. From coffee to non coffee, teas, and foods. The price range varied started from 25k++.

The baristas are also nice, so that's a plus.

This is the place you are looking for work or study.

Good coffee! They have outdoor and indoor seating. The indoor seatings are comfortable to just chill or do tasks, while the outdoor seatings are more suitable for hangout with friends. A good coffee experience."

Turn out by far its the best modern coffee shop in the whole city, mo kalian penyuka kopi asli apa penggemar kopi abal-abal kayak saya, they accommodate it..

Always love their frozen yogurt üç¶fresh and delicious. They have various toppings to go on your froyo as well, like strawberry, kiwi, lychee, jelly, longan, mochi, almonds, and many more. For a single froyo, they only charge you IDR 23k. It‚Äôs quite a deal!

When there was no serving required the whole bunch would go about themselves and make a crowd again.

One exception for they guy with glasses who was providing better hospitality .

Food generally were salty.

Nice place to hang out and remote working. They serve Indonesian food and they taste good. The grilled oxtail soup is the bomb. I think it‚Äôs the spices/herbs that makes it perfect. Also, gotta love the irish latte. ü§ôüèº

The place is nice and cozy, located in the city center the cafe is always crowded so you have to prepare your self. The food taste is good, not that perfectly good but quite good. The price is affordable, quite shocked about it, coz i think it will be expensive.
The service on the other hand, they need improvement. They lack of smile dan lack of speed, but it still in the bare minimum so well still kinda okay...

Before today, Sara was on some spot on the same street; it was smaller and looked like other bakery. Now they are taking it to another level.
Sara takes advantage from the building original colonial architecture to present warm atmosphere for customers. With calm yellow light and some colorful wall and garden decoration, customers are welcomed to have some humble-but-classy dining.
They serve familiar snacks, such fried banana and fries, decent and well cooked. Some meals like fried rices are also available for those hungry tummy to fill before a long chit chat over coffee. The coffee prices are reasonable and brewed perfectly balance. What I do like from their coffee is that they present it separated from the sugar, so I never miss the original taste.
Sara is a family and small group friendly place to spend quality time at. And still, this place is suitable for customers of all ages.

a cake shop located in a quiet & cool area.  you can find many European & Indonesian snack here,.. dine in with a cup of coffee in the morning and you will ready to face your day. cheers!

Loves their traditional cakes and ice creams. Open early morning at 6 am, such a good start for our busy day.

They have a live music as well on the weekend start at 6 pm.

Their location is unbeatable.. open space restaurant and located exactly in front of The Shalimar Garden.

menu : they sell simple dish indonesian food such as nasi goreng, and they sell varieties of traditional cakes , recommended for the cakes

In fact its location is in the middle of a village. You need to be very meticulous to find it. The house seems to be an old one, the one that hasn't gone through much renov. It is left almost as its original form. The furnishings are also vintage. The owner or the barrista, I am not sure which, is very friendly young man. I bought its signature, called Iced-Coffee Kane (delicious Iced-Coffee), which is creamy and strong.

One of the small local coffeeshop that makes me impressed. It's because their signature coffee taste differ from another coffeeshop in Malang. They are not only following the trend, but they pay attention to their quality. My favorite is Es Kopi Susu Kane, paired it with a freshly homemade donut. You have to try it.

'Drink coffee at home' is the concept of this place. Built in the barista/owner's own house, the ambience feels so homey, reminds me of my grandpa's home back in my hometown somehow. But still has a little touch of coffeeshop with a small bar in the corner. Has lots of coffee beans, from arabika to robusta. Tried their filtered tolu batak, latte, and es susu kopi (ice coffee milk), tasted good, made with manual machine. For a non coffee drinker, try the Galauincinno ice, their special recipe, a beverage made of milk, coffee, ice, and palm sugar! A unique one, but taste really good! Affordable price, from 5k to 20k.

You will never expect a coffee shop at a quite place like this, is really traditionally and vintage place with many kind of arabica and robusta coffee, you will be spoiled by the whole coffee things

Es Kopi Kane from this coffee shop has special and unique taste. Pricing is standard. Available for take away and delivery service from food delivery app."

My verdict of this place:
‚Ä¢ Friendly barista
‚Ä¢ Wi-Fi is reliable
‚Ä¢ Try their coffee mocktails! I thought espresso mixed with vanilla-lemon-spices will tastes weird but well I was wrong; definitely going to come back to try another menus
‚Ä¢ Their Chicken Schnitzel visually looks like tempe goreng tepung lol but taste-wise it‚Äôs quite good!

Taste Good, but little bit pricey. Only snacks available.

Good weekend place to get drunk.
Got billiard table for you to play is a plus.
The employee is good, got many promo, better ask the waiter what promo is going on. Usually there is, but sometimes there isn't.
Overall, this place is good for you to have fun together in groups and drinks to your liking.

Really lucky i dont give you low stars.. The only thing stopping me is the atmosphere and design also how you have a pool table in good condition, bar service also great.

Staffs were the friendliest!

Manual brew was gooood. The barista actually cared and suggested which beans would go with what method and asked what kind of profile patrons looked for.

Iced black was not the best, but it was v enjoyable. The creaminess of the Es Kopi Susu Candu was great, but the overall taste was not my fave. White was bitter and watery somehow.

Cheesecake can have more tartness to it, martabak croissant had good flakiness considering the fillings, fried rice was good and the spices actually stood up, chicken parm was okay.

The milky orange cat was the best!!! üòª

They need smaller tables in the non-smoking areas so ppl wouldn‚Äôt feel too guilty for having the whole table for themselves when they prefer not too sit among the smokers.

i do really like their choux latte and creme brule latte.
its the best latte they offerred, imo.
the place is separated into smoking and non-smoking room. thats great.
wifi is also great.
but one thing i do reaaaallly mind is about the flies.
ugh..maybe because its located near the traditional market, but owner need to think this over and solve this flies problem.

Coffee taste is good. But, need improvement about service quality for customers.

The place is good. Food are moderate. I like the burger, but not for the rice bowl. The coffees are also good. The only thing I mind is about the seatings. They only has indoor and sofa seating for one group. So if its already occupied, you have to take the outdoor seating with uncomfy chair and hot air. Yes because Pekalongan is damn hot.

The salted egg chicken was nice
But the garlic butter something was too much garlic.. make the taste weird

Many times order here from go food and grab food .. they never read the note!!!!!!!! I asked for well cook egg!!! And sometimes its comes without cutlery etc

They have a huge portion for a rice box. The garlic butter chicken boxy is plain for me and the garlic is too much on the chicken. The thai tea is also too many ices, so the flavor is plain. After all, they have nice packaging.

Small, quiet yet comfy place with tasty meals & drinks. Keep your work stay at the office while you take your lunch time here. And by the way, dont forget to bring on your friends too :)

For a box meal, the portion is huge, just like regular meal. Have some choices of sauce, from classic salted egg until sambal matah sauce. The place itself is cozy, with black and modern-themed open room.

They mainly sell alcoholic beverages, but don't worry, they also provide non alcoholic. Their cocktail was good, all drinks were good on my visit. Quite cheap, -+30k/cup for cocktail. Very recommended.

Great place to hangout and drink with friends, it has very nice concept and decoration. You can feel really different ambience downstairs, makes you lost track in time.

Unfortunately, not for people who come to chitchat with friends, because the music is too loud for me.

Reasonable. You can get the fancy dish for around 20k-50k

The service is ok. The waiter and cashier are so friendly

At night there are cute lights! The food and cappuccino are so good! And they have delicious drinks as well!

My favorite here is aglio o lio with extra mushrooms, the fried rice is also delicious, the coffee is great.  The atmosphere is good and friendly service.

Although this cafe is a standalone building and rather large in size, it can be easy to miss due to its awkward location around a bend of a road. It has wide open outdoor spaces which would make it a very pleasant experience if not for the fact that there are some roadworks going on right in front of it.

We had an iced coffee which wasnt bad, but the other order, which was the cold flowering tea was rather bland and tasteless. When i inquired what flowers are included in the flowering tea, the polite but a little uninformed staff answered me ""random flowers""

Nice place to spend my morning for breakfast on weekend. Nice atmosphere but a bit noisy from the construction process behind. Food has a good taste with reasonable price.

they sell coffee beans and roasted by themselves.
i tried the cappucinno, they use arabica coffee for the espresso and it's good.
the minus is the toilet separated with the cafe (sharing toilet) and it's not clean :(

Been trying all their menus, and their signature just the best.
Cozy places divided by smoking and non smoking room.
If you want to find a comfortable, homie coffee shop with no buzz crowded, this just the right place to go.

My favorite spot is in the corner next to their roasting room, on non smoking area or you even can called it coworking space. colokan dimana mana, banyak tanaman. Makanannya enak (they just opened their Aromatic Kitchen).

And their hospitality just the best!

Baristas/waitresses do not understand how to serve customers properly.

They are relaxed and just sitting in front of the coffee machine, but they are reluctant to help us and provide good service.

At that time, there were no other customers at that time, because they had just opened and were still very quiet.

The price of coffee that we pay is quite expensive.

It turns out that the price paid is not worth the service that is obtained.

The coffee shop is in the Batik Adiningrat store. It is close order, so you must order and pay directly. Then you need to wait for your order to be made because it's self service here.

My first time in here but the places for charging only in some tbles

Not a quite place that I would thought it be..my first time and maybe my last.

Edit : I do ask to the waitress for it, but he only shown some and it all use by some people the left side (from the front door) use by 2 girls then right side there are 3 tables and 2 tables have the charging spot and use by 1 people per table. And even I ask him is there any charging place at the outdoor side and the table I sit, but he said there are no charging spot.

was here when they just opened the store and comin back here when the store is wider with a collab to Dua Legenda. the coffee is a real mantap jaya. the cashier is so polite and helpful. a great experience. will come back for sure.

The coffee shop decoration is like in the 40's but yeah nothings really cool, in the other hand the coffee is quite good

It's a good place for hangout with friends, the foodies and beverages are delicious and especially the manual brewed coffee I loved it, but it's not recommend for people who find serenity.

The taste of coffee is really good, they also provide non coffee as well for you who doesn‚Äôt really like caffeine. But the place is standard, maybe cause they tried to make old ambience."

The beverage flavor balance. It's clean, hygienic, cool. There are two floors, but they use the first floor more often.

Fairly priced. Coffee starts from 15K. Snacks starts from 18K. The price on the menu are before tax, so there will be a slightly change when you want to pay.

Taste is average. I ordered Iced Americano and it tasted kinda watery, right after they served me.

Cozy place. It's the perfect place to have a me-time, good ambiance, not too noisy.

The place is nice with modern japanese vibe. There are various drink and rice bowl listed in their menu. I ordered matcha latte and it was good but it came in a small glasses. The donut is just ok, reasonable price (12K). The other pastry is affordable too, around 12K to 20K. My friend ordered the rice bowl and coffee, and they liked it. It's hard to find a coffee shop in Solo that is worth to visit often, and this is more likely one of them.

The ambience was really nice and cozy. Not too pricey and the interior is a plus one for me. Too bad the parking lot is a bit small. Another one that I like, there's a smoking room for smoker.

Second time enjoying coffee shop! Asagao brought japanese atmosphere to their coffeshop. In my visit, i order americano and french fries. Its quiet and clean at that time (maybe i was the first customer in that day). Since it bring up japanese themed coffee shop, they serve my americano in a kind of ocha cup. For the price, its cheaper than my first coffee shop."

You should try their cheesecakeüòçüç∞!! It is surprisingly good and it‚Äôll only cost you IDR 15k! I also ordered their Coffee Latte which tasted ok, not bad, but didn‚Äôt really meet my expectation. I should try another drink for the next visit.

The place has a relaxed ambience, especially when it‚Äôs not too crowded. I sat on the ground floor (its a two story high building) and people around me were busy with their laptops, so I guess it‚Äôs a proper place for you to focus on your work here.

The baristas are friendly and kind, they will welcome you and say thank you before you leave the cafe. It‚Äôs kinda cute bc they do it all together, reminds me of how indom*ret greets their customers ü•∫

I think you need to train your barista more about hospitality,, good place,, big parking space,, lot of table,, sadly come with below hospitality standard,, and taste?? Not so much,, it's not good,, but I can't say bad neither,,

my first impression was: the menu is really variative, with affordable price range. the croissant is also really good, crispy yet buttery. definitely must try. i really like the iced coffee latte. i also ordered caesar salad, which surprisingly came in big portion. definitely will come back to try other menu!

I remembered that this bakery was succesfully made a good impression to me especially for their ciabatta bread, but i think recently their quality is not as good as before. Its still enjoyable but i have to say that they could be better..
If you have time, go dine in or takeaway is cheaper than order via grab/gojek since they will upcharge price up to 20%.

Karena hari pertama, tempatnya rame bangetttt dan camilannya masih sedikit juga. I would recommend this place to you!‚ú®

Nice industrial vibes and nice grounded coffee blend

One of the cafes in Suhat is located next to the Sahid Montana hotel.  This cafe is not too wide but very homey.  The table provided is enough for groups and alone.  The menu offered is interesting, tastes good and has many choices.  Chocolate and coffee based drinks are highly recommended.  For snacks I recommend churros and fries.  One thing that is a little annoying for me personally, sometimes too many people smoke, so the smoke gathers until the table and my clothes smell of cigarette smoke, for passive smokers like me, it's quite disturbing.  Maybe there needs to be another way and regulation to handle my complaint.  thanks.

First of all, nice interior concept, just like an old gold mining site. I drank their coldbrew and it tastes great, mild and fruity. Next time I'll go there, I'd love to enjoy my coldbrew without an ice cube, it might taste a lot better. Overall, as a newcomers, they offer a great Australian culture coffeeshop. You should go there.

Have been trying their several different menus and here's my top three so far:
1. Iced hojicha; it's creamy and thick, the flavour is quite deep, not overly sweetÔºçjust a perfect bittersweet combination
2. French fries with this yellow sauce and mozzarella (I forgot the actual name in the menu üòÇ); because cheese will never be wrong!
3. Beef kebab; the sauce is exceptional!

Unfortunately, I can't give any review about their coffee because tbh my body cannot 'cooperate' at all with any coffee intake, but I can still say this is a nice place to spend the time. The place is not really wide but it's super cozy and calming„Éºsuch a perfect workspace. Not too crowded but it's not empty either. Staffs and owner are very humble and friendly, and they will explain anything if you ask them about the menu. I had a really good time here, and I won't be hesitating to visit this place again and try their other menus!"

Well, its nice and good and cozy.. the menu itself is not really expensive. Good for groups as well as individual. If you are going to bring young kids, it also fine. This place serves a nice drink, but only so so for the snack. If you are going to work or doing your school/work assignments then its suitable since this place has electronic station in every tables. Thus you should be fine. But do not come in rush hour otherwise you are going to distracted a lot since there are a lot of crowd. Ah yes, its easily visible from the street as well.

Actually it's a good place for hanging out. The surrounding view is beautifull. I've been here twice. For the first visit, I barely had any complain. The food was okay. The beverages were good. We ordered iga bakar and it's not too pricy considering the portion. When I got here the second time, I ordered nasi goreng / fried rice. Not so pleasant experience. The rice is waaayyy too oily. And very much under seasoned. Can't even taste the salt. I could only take a view spoons of it before giving up. I think more training for the cook will do good for business.

Spacy. There's indoor and outdoor places. Good snacks and drinks for meeting with some friends or just hanging out. Good place for discussion but not for a serious meeting at over 7pm. Cause its usually crowded.

it has some instagramable spot to take pic. nice place to hang out with friends and family. my favorite menu is basil fried rice. it has unique taste but it take a  long time serving

This cafe was one of the list that I should visit on my weekend. The snack & drink are good, I couldn't say it's special, but all good. I don't feel that I can't spend more than 3 hours here.

Strategic place between main road of Batu and malang, very reasonable price in the middle of mega inflation, you can comfortably hang with spending below 50k rupiah and thats a pretty good deal, portion a bit small but that‚Äôs understandable due to their prices, ended up order again after our first meal, oh yeah, the place is cute too!

The place has Mediterranean/greek vibes, a bit different than many others ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù coffee shop üëç

You‚Äôll be helped for parking, the lot can take abt 10 cars, the guy was very helpful

A great place to enjoy good local-western style dining experience. The place offers mixture of local-western cuisine (pasta, spaghetti, etc). Some of the menu is a fusion with local cuisine, such as fried rice, satay, etc. We really like the taste of the cuisine. The amount of spice and rice portion is very good. Not too much, just perfect.
In addition, the building aechitecture is very beautiful. I believe it is a combination of tropical-mediterranian style architecture. Probably one of the most beautiful restaurant in Malang. Great place to relax and enjoy.
One thing I would like to be improved, the reservation and payment is made in one desk only. It will be difficult for you to choose menu and making reserveation, while another customers are waiting in line behind you. Why couldn't you just put to seat the customer in their table while making the reservation directly. By then, you will not mixing the resevation line with the payment line."

I quite curious of this place, I accompanied my friend to try this place. The first, you can see the whole place, it's nice. There is a room like private room for us who need doing homework and outdoor. I ordered rice bowl chicken skin and coffe latte. The taste of food is not good little (kurang pas), so I hope they can improve the taste in their food. Then, the price is quite expensive, because it's far from the city area with that price and I compared with other cafe I think it's quite expensive. But all is good.

Nice place to hang out,and refreshing at Batu city.  Good place , Good taste of food, price moderate. They Have Rooftoop so you can enjoy the beautiful panorama there.

Found this place when I was travelling in Batu, its located 500m near jatim park 2. Available menu is variable, starting from western, indonesian, and etc. Food price range start from 20k to tenderloin steak 65k. Its affordable. Tastes good and worth the price. It's spacious, good for sight-seeing. You can see mountains in the day and city lights in the night. Suitable for family gathering, wifi available for each floor, suitable for doing assignments with friends.  There is a lot of parking space too. Will definitely come back here next time.

The staff are nice and the store is clean.  Coffee is cheap and delicious.

clean and tasty salad. i love the salad and chocolate drinks from their menu.

Not the best affogato at Loop Graha Famili. But it came with a glass of water without being asked. Nice. And they have a wide range of food menu. No wonder folks come here early morning after cycling or having their morning walk/jog.

I have a quite bad experience in here. The coffee didn't taste anything like coffee. And the baristas didn't seem understand their own product. I have high expectation because I heard lots of good reviews from my friends. I can't even finish my drink because the taste is really weird. Hope I can have better experience next time visit here.

Cool place, good grub. Waffles were tasty and filling, smoothie bowls were yoghurty instead of pure ice which I prefer (smaller than usual but for the price you can't complain, you can literally buy 2 if needs be). Super helpful and friendly guys running it, they helped sort/buy our train tickets and even did scrambled eggs on a waffle for us which they seemed very confused about haha. If you're in Malang, head here.

This place is awesome. Located in front of a house (actually a women center) this place serves you waffle with various and healthy topping. Also, there are smoothies with a lot of healthy nut and seeds. But unfortunately, oftenly when i visit this place is closed, because they have to support outdoor events. But, you have to try it.

The kombucha is on point! the chicken is good but the sauce is just average.

its my first time came here. I came here with friends and order a drink and the same food for each of us.. They have a very slow service, our drink was served after 30ish minutes and the food were arrive after one (1) hour. We already go back and forth asking them and they always say that its because the rice is not ready. and we are not the only table waiting in such a loooong time like that.

It is very sad tho, they could learn something about supply chain management and communication between team to prevent this kind of issue.

The service is good, the cashier and one of the waiters are friendly and answer all our questions despite the crankyness we had (hungry due to waiting for an hour).

I like the chicken & kombuca here!

A small local restaurant/cafe with great service, food, drink and overall experience! They have a rooftop and oke bgt waktu senja2 dateng kesini!
Definitely a go-to place for cafe when you are in malang Huge portion of roasted chicken (which is tasty) & side dishes are delicious as well.

A lil bit shocked that malang has a place to drink kombucha in a market. Their kombucha is nice but i think if only they can make it more sweet. Price is not too pricey. Better come in the afternoon

It has a wide selection of coffee. But, don't expect a single brew or any roastery. The foods are also great taste. It has a competitive price.

The place is decent I would say, I especially loved the interior and outdoor settings. The cafe has transformed the dutch building with blue and white stylings. Quite different what you easily see, for me the architecture stand out when I was driving my motorcycle, piqued my curiosity.
The coffee was fine, not the best. Expecting the manual V60 Japanese brew to be more delicate but it‚Äôs mainly depend on the barista to bring out the taste.

I think this is one of those cafes where you can spend time chatting with a group of friends. Well, it's great for couples too but I think the vibe is not so much suitable for that.
First time at Hindia, we ordered hazelnut latte, some kind of tea and their platter menu. Well, I can't say something special about those three menus.
But I think they need to reconsider putting away those tables placed on the outer side of the outdoor area.

It is a coffee shop and eatery as well. Coffee is basically prepared from a group of selected beans with a coffee machine; so there is nothing special. The menu is rather complete, offering main dishes and snacks. The price is affordable and the location is strategic.

Good beverages. I ordered avocado coffee and it's pretty okay-ish. The food surprisingly came out really good. We ordered kwetiau and banana fritters. The kwetiau was great, meanwhile the banana was okay. The place overall was comfortable, but the service wasn't that great.

a two-story hidden spot in jakal; very humble and sweet.

it had minimum signs and looked very small from the outside. as i went in, i could see that they try to make use of their space as best as possible. the 1st floor, filled with music and the friendliest staff, could fit 8-10 people. the 2nd floor, however, was like entering a whole new place.

as i went up, the music got quieter and quieter, and it was almost silent when i reached the floor. it was truly like a library ‚Äî filled with books you could borrow and just the right amount of peace to read, study, and get things done. there were enough extension cords which made me stay there throughout the day.

i asked to order iced water at the register and was a bit surprised to find out it's free. the main courses were out of stock so i bought a donut. i believe they serve the donuts with random fillings and i got tiramisu. it was soft and chewy, the right amount of sweet.

i was also happy to see toilets available in every floor. they were very clean! them using metal straws was also a personal plus. the wifi was top notch, too. will definitely be one of my go-tos whenever i want to work and study!

loooove the ambiece especially the second floor. it's like you found a hidden paradise to read a book and it couldn't be more perfect bcos there is a small library there that you could actually lend the books! the barista had very friendly service, clean place, bright room (to study or read), there is indoor and outdoor area. prices are average. will definitely coming here again if i need some time alone but don't really wanna be alone.

Only sells some mixed variant of iced coffee. Tea fusion isn't gonna bring you anywhere but mint-berry-lemon squash. Too many milk added in chocolate.

Anyway this place offers a productive yet quiet (very) working space located at second floor. There's even a library installed at the side of the wall. A rather downside is its chair kinda uncomfortable, creaking here and there, while some of the tables are quite shaky. Hope they fix it.

Very clean toilet, that's a plus

Unfortunately no praying room for muslim, you'd have to go to some nearest gas station to do your daily prayer

Hot midday i ride along jalan kaliurang, i saw Sintesis Coffee and Space, small and interesting. Walk in the Sintesis i amaze with interior of 1st floor. They have a good coffee and comfortable place to hang out and study. They have a library in the second floor. Wow!

Great place to chill out with friends/couples/families, accompanied by hot/cold drink + pastries with decent price and music. Decorated with hanging lights and well designed cafe.

Just another cafe with some live music on the weekend.
Quite cozy atmosphere with bean bag sofas set up

All in all, nothing special

They have nice calming ambience, making it surprisingly cozy to spend a Sunday afternoon.
In addition, they have a selection of signature coffee. I tried their Baileys Coffee and I love it.
They also offer snacks and main dishes. The one we ordered was the sandwich which is actually quite decent.
Overall, it was a pleasant experience enjoying our 'kopi sore' here.

This is house-cafe which Balinese touch next to a campus area. Coming here on Saturday morning, spots were available, probably due to the campus off-day. Stepping through concrete pads to the spinning door, I was welcomed by a calm home atmosphere on Sunday morning to meet good coffee drinks with friendly prices.
The coffee stands its true flavor decorated by a milky splash. It definitely suits those who care for some caffeine boost. A point that bothers me personally is just that it was served in a plastic glass, loosening the authentic touch.
Dekker Koffie is unquestionably a nice place for transit before heading home from work. The greens in and  around the venue absorb fatigue to help customers bring home a  fresh smile.

Have u tried this place? U should! I especially love the coffee, any kind of their coffee is suitable for me. And the ambience is very cozy, nice place to hang out or spend ur time in goodway.

The caf√© has a great ambience both outside and inside the caf√©. It has a delicious food you can order for lunch.

Overall this caf√© is comfortable for hangout with friends. The coffee is good tho. The price? Way cheaper than the overated caf√© around there üòÇ"

An affordable cafe and restaurant with wide range menu. They serve pasta(of course,lol) and other local menus like fried rice and ayam geprek. You should try the Ayam Geprek because its yummy and the portion is quite satisfying. The pasta has small portion so you probably wanna add some more food. The beverages are delicious.

Good selection of coffee and many promotion items offered. Little bit crowd at lunch and dinner. Equipped with wifi and power socket.

Wonderfull place at a mall that not so great! Good quality coffee n food!

still one of my favourite coffee shop and cafe in town. the coffee are good and smells really nice. not to mention the original coffee, but I also think the other menu with coffee ingredients are still good. They do not put too much unrelated additional ingredients and maintain the real taste of coffee.

They serve some dishes and main course, some of them are really delicious while some are okay. Well, I don't usually go here to get the food, but the coffee and the place to hangout.

The place, here in Plaza Surabaya branch in particular is nice and have a good ambience. love it. the chair are really cozy, but somehow I feel the chair are to big compared to the table. but, it is okay anyway. they have WiFi, non smoking area, and some electrical socket.

The prices is practically quite costly, but they serve you with best quality of coffee, food, place, and services. so, it is fine.

overall, I would recommend this place for hanging out or if you want to grab some nice cup of coffees.

Various types of drinks and food are available at this cafe. It has ground floor room facilities in Surabaya Plaza with nice view to beautiful outdoor road. Can be visited with colleagues or alone. The cafe room allows visitors to smoke. Cafe opening hours in accordance with the opening hours of Surabaya Plaza mall."

this time I will tell you about my experience and what I feel after visiting this cafe. The first time I visited this cafe with my junior high school friend in Malang, he to be the one who told me about this place. okay, at that time we visited this place at 10 pm, this place is still crowded, it just so happens that this cafe has 3 floors, the first floor is the cashier and also a few tables for visitors, then on the 2nd floor is an indoor room where this room is covered with glass, lots of tables and mostly used by students who want to do assignments. because on the 2nd floor there is no smoking allowed. so it is very comfortable to work in focus. on the 2nd floor there is also a toilet whose design is very futuristic and of course interesting. okay, because at that time I sat on the 3rd floor there was a lively atmosphere, lots of people hanging out with their friends because the rooftop on this floor allowed smoking, there is also a bar here and there are lots of tables on the 3rd floor, we can also see the city lights. and the service at this cafe is quite good, the employees are friendly, but because the place is very busy it makes them a bit of a hassle.

I just passed through Malang and so happen got tired and get some rest here. The cappucino was meh, it taste like instant coffee. The ice cream was nice, I buy kopyor ice cream and it's decent for 15RB price. Not so sweet just as I like it. The place was spacious. Lot's of collage students there getting some work done. Pretty cheap and cozy fast internet and clean. I went to 3rd floor and since Malang is kinda cold that day it's really nice. Overall 7/10. Maybe after taste some dishes I could increase it. Maybe next time

Cheap food and coffee, wide and comfy, dont use 3rd floor if it sunny.. too hot. Okay when at night

WOW is one of the cafes located in Malng City. With a very aesthetic location and suitable for doing tasks because of its convenient and cool location.
There is also live music so we don't get bored to hang out there. However , the prices there do not match student friendly , students and even boarding children like me with drinks priced above 20,000 Because I think it's expensive.
However, the menu is not boring. The special menu at WARUNK WOW KWB is Rice Bowl, Indomie, Roti Bakar (Rotkar), Coffee which is famous as a cheap menu with priced under 20.000 . But with a modern and luxurious presentation."

one of my fav cafe, all the drinks are delicious, dessert and meal are good in taste, the price so cheap but the taste are good,comfortable for chilling with friend,they have a lot varians menu, the place are clean with good service,the parking area is not wide.

Overall, it was a pleasant experience dining out here. We orderes several dishes: Chicken Nanban, Meatball something and Matcha Kitkat Cake. For the drinks, we had Cappucino Caramel Crumble and Buttercookies Tea.
The foods taste great. I could tolerate the crunchiness of the chicken katsu, while the sauce completes it really well. It's savory and creamy.
The Meatball also kinda startled us because they use some kinda strawberry sauce. It's new for us. Surprisingly, its sourness and sweetness don't overpower the savory taste of the meatball and mashed potato.
For the dessert, I picked the matcha cake. I could really taste the matcha flavor out of it while its not being too sweet. I love it.
I'd probably revisit the place to try another cake on the selections.

Katamichi is 1 of the best and comfiest cafe in town. It's decoration is awesome and cute. Food and baverage here is delicious, you gonna find them cute and lovely as well. Recommend this place for hang out with your friend or do your work. Their tea and cake is super recommended. You also gonna find some cute stuff there!
Everything will be perfect if the place have Japanese song on their Playlist, so the ambience is truly Japanese.

If youre looking place that offered very spacious place, with good ambience and minimalistic design but price doesn't matter and the foods are edible this is the place. The place have very good vibe and design, food was okay, it was good 6.5/10, nothing special but also overpriced. One plate of food cost around 50k-150k, the fries cost whopping 40k+. So if youre visiting the place,remember that youre paying extra for the place not the foods. The coffee was good tho, i'd visit again just for the drink and place.

Spacious place. Comfortable to meet friends or working on laptop.
The food is a little bit pricy but the taste is standard. Slow service (took long time only to refill the tea‚Äôs hot water). I bring the pot to the counter and gave it to the waitress. But no action. I went to the counter again and asked for the refill! Omg so slow

They claimed ""kopi giras"" as their specialty coffee, which I suspect was a variety of Javanese robusta. Other warkop drinks such as iced coffee and other sweet drinks are also available.

They also served nice condiment: deep fried tempe tepung which tastes good together with the petis. On top of that, the price range is really cheap! They open 24 hours and have a lot of electric terminal in case you need to charge your phone (I believe it's a popular spot to play MOBA with your team because of this).

The last time I came here with friends, the place is clean, comfortable, even provides a prayer room.

the price is kinda cheap for the food that they sell... the taste just so so.
can be a great option for you to get a dinner, the places is cozy.

Not a big place, and the location is quite far from Malang downtown, but the design is really interesting, kinda industrial, but has a homey vibe. And since it has an open bar setting, you can have coffee talk with the barista, Mas Pandu, also the owner of this coffee shop. Lataroma means house yard, which is literally built in the owner's house yard. Yang jadi ciri khas di sini adalah semuanya serba manual, mulai dari mesin roastingnya, espresso, sampai untuk steam susunya.

They serve this delicious fusion udon (xilao udon) - a combination of creamy broth, udon, chicken with sweet soy sauce as the topping and you can add sambal matah. Another menu, ‚Äúroti sri rich‚Äù (srikaya) also have nice taste, it‚Äôs not too sweet

This place is located on the 2nd floor of Pasar Kranggan. Went there on CNY evening, the place was not crowded. The Roti Sri Rich and Coklat Butter were good. (I wish they offer original butter toast in the future because the toast bread was that good). Worth the price and highly recommended.

I know this place is famous on social media and highly recommend it. The place is simple because it is located on the 2nd floor of the Kranggan market, the concept of a shop with an authentic Chinese coffee shop in general but halal. The payment system here, pay first and then your order will be delivered, besides that for disabled access you have to climb stairs because the shop is located above. No wifi, toilet or prayer room available.
First time here, the menu offered is varied, but I only ordered the butter coffee which is the signature of this coffee shop. The coffee tastes like ginseng coffee with butter, I think it's delicious. For the second time, I ordered butter coffee, sri rich bread (jam sarikaya bread), Mie udon (udon noodles topped with chopped chicken and mushrooms), and chocolate ice. All the food is delicious, the Sri Rich bread is better when it's still warm, the chocolate ice is very delicious, most of the chocolate ice sold is mostly water than the chocolate, the udon noodles are delicious (the sauce is tasty, the chicken topping is delicious and uniquely uses sambal matah), I want to pay  expensive if the udon portion is upgraded haha. I like it, i will come often.

Kranggan market is really hype nowadays and this place is one of the hottest. Udon xilao (25k) has unique taste; chewy noodles with creamy broth, topped with (kinda of indonesian chicken noddles) many chicken meat and also (kinda of) sambal matah as a condiment. It was good."

The food is delicious with aesthetic arrangement and the drink is nice, comes in fairly cheap price start from IDR 30.000. The service is handy and excellent, the employees is kind. The interior and exterior design is artistic and aesthetic, feels like dining in home with family with cozy atmosphere. This place also has games like guitar, uno, and chess. This place also has free WiFi. Suitable for study and work, or if you just want to eat alone in cozy atmosphere. Gotta recommended this place.

Its located on a remote location, but okay

To be honest i didn't know (or probably never know) if i didn't accidently passed this cafe on my way back home. This cafe is pretty decent for  some remote area/place, it has some cozzy sensation thatvyou usually find on high end cafe on Jakarta or its surrounding. Overall this place have all you need for a stereotype cafe.

The only minus that i'm aware of is the location and place. The first, as i already mentioned it's located on a remote area so it will be hard to find for ordinary people. The second one, although just because someplace located on a remote area doesn't mean the place is definitely small and doesn't have enough parking lot, but on this occasion its is. It will be very difficult if you planned to go into this cafe with a car, because there is no dedicated parking lot for car and even if you planned to go with motorcycle, make sure you go with an single motorcycle if you want park on this cafe.

But after all, this place is overally good if you put aside the location an vehicle problem and just i said before, this place have all you need for a stereotype cafe.

A nice hidden place for a cup of coffee and a cozy atmosphere. Great wifi, great ambience, pretty good coffee but a lack access for parking especially if you ride a car. It opens from 10 AM in the morning."

The place is nice with affordable food. The two signature drinks are konco es kopi (ice coffee with milk, I guess.

Menus are pretty good, we tried some and every single ones were spot on.
My favorite are the paddlepop cream boba.

Definitely one of a kind in Klaten. Healthy meals, fresh smoothies, toast and coffee are their specialities. Overall, portion of the meals are worthy for 20K-ish price. Try their signature coffee.

I ordered ice milk coffee called Pasti Kopi Susu and it turned out good.

Surprisingly at this nylempit place you can find  a cozy place to hang with your friends or just doing your stuff on laptop.

The coffee they serve is quite interesting. You can find es kopi susu with brown sugar here. Si refreshing!

Their accident coffee (maksudnya kopi tubruk) is quite strong. Its aroma is very good.

Lots of interesting drinks. Coffee, tea, or.. me? üòúüòú

But the camilans they serve is rather limited. Their cinnamon roll bun is quite nice. You can cokot it than use fork or spoon.

I like their interior design. Especially at evening. You can get beautiful selfie-selfie here.

Nice place.

And very helpful and friendly owner.

Well I think this place is pretty much great except for the fact that the air conditioner is not working. It was a rainy afternoon, I needed place for my homework and I remembered my friend told me about this place a long time ago. They have small room and limited table which is fine to me, but with limited air circulation I am getting sweaty and sweaty then I decided to leave. Fix the air conditioner and perhaps I‚Äôll go there again someday.

Even though its location takes more effort to reach from the main street, you'll be glad to discover some of their finest beverages... especially coffee. I personally choose their ""Pasti Kopi Susu"" as it suits my taste so well, it has a gentle flavor which is hard to describe here, so just find out yourself. The atmosphere of this place is great, many good spot to take beauty shot or a perfect selfie for your social media needs. I love their fast wifi connection and calm indie music playing in the background. Both barista are also cheerful and definitely the person you'll be willing to tell your story with.

Once you enter the gate, it feels like they transformed you to Bali right away. I also like their extensive menu, so many variations of food and beverage.

Service is top notch, place is cozy, not too crowded, song playlist is also great. Food is good (chicken quesadillas and their Japanese salad are must-have). Will come back often!

It‚Äôs really nice and cozy cafe with tropical ambience, you‚Äôll feel in Bali once you step in their gate. All the food and drinks that I ordered was good with fast service.

Bit pricy maybe for the city but yes it's worth a fine dining experience ! Taste so delicious and yet plating was awesome!! Quiet for meeting  or dating ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©very recommended . 2 tumb for the chef !!

I went here twice. The first time I went with my sister. We ordered Horenso salad. It was so good, especially the sauce. It was sour, sweet and something that I can't describe. Also the veggies was so fresh.
I also ordered Chicken steak (for me, it was regular chicken steak) but the sauce was yummy and chicken pop. I am not recommended chicken pop. It was hard. Then, for drink I ordered Green Republic. I like it.
The second time ordered Chicken Fajitas. I think they have specialty in sauce. Again, the sauce was superb. I want more the sauceü•≤.
Last but not least was coffee latte. I don't like it. Just like reguler coffe latte that I made in home.
I didn't see if they have baby chair. Maybe you can asked them if you plan with your baby. I saw prayer place for Muslim and the toilet was cleaned.

If you have plan to Fertisoil I recommend the salad and Chicken Fajitas or something that has sauce. They have special sauces in their menu.

i feel like the price is kinda pricey for a cafe in malang. but i like their egg croissant sandwich! that's good. another well designed cafe in malang, i like their minimalistic concept. even though their place is kinda small, but they have non smoking and smoking area, they even have outdoor area. thinking of coming back someday!"

1. Hidden Gems Coffee Shop.
Well, for the first time I was really surprise with this coffee shop. To find it you should come to the small alley that only fit with one car. But when you arrive at the cafe you would gonna love it.
2. The design.
They are actually very homy coffee shop. You would gonna find a lot of tree, plant flower, green grass & cat. The architecture of this cafe is like a open space home which is very cozy. They have indoor area & outdoor area.
3. The Food & Drink.
Well they are really good at coffee. I think owner this cafe really understand about coffee. They have V60, tubruk, french press and other method coffee brewing & also they are really carefully choose the coffee bean they use.
They only serf the best coffee bean (Arabica /Robusta) for customer.
4. The Man Power.
They have three barista and all the barista very friendly, smart, diligent & helpful.
They work very fast to serve drink / snack. They are actually pretty skill full and know about how to make a best coffee.
I was order Aceh Gayo with V60 method and the barista (name Iqbal) give me the delicious extraction that masterfully balance flavour clarity & satisfying body. Good job üëç .
5. The Price.
Well the price is very affordable, best of the best of the town compare to the other coffee shop in Kediri.
6. What make this coffee shop is special because the power of ""social interaction"" . Every body that visit this place is talking each other, sometime they play game (Chess, uno or poker) and you will hear laugh & smile on their face. It is very good, mean human interaction create a good ambience.
7. Now Kopicab become my second home, every weekend I always visit this place, and I would absolutely recommend this place for you to visit.

Thank You Kopicab, you are awesome ü§ò

The crowd was acceptable when I visited the place, so it was nice to have a talk here. For the menu, I ordered their latte and fish and chips. The latte was fine while their fish n chips exceeds my expectation. The fish was fried perfectly. It's crunchy on the outside and delicate in the inside. The sauce which kinda made of mayonnaise and mushroom also taste super great. It's the cherry on top for the dish.

Very nice cafe with friendly staff. Vietnamese drip coffee and creamy mango drink are awesome. Good wi-fi and clean toilets. Extra space in floor above.

Delicious coffee, lovely place, tasty food. A little bit hidden but interior is really nice and has potential - see also level 2. hope that quality will help it to exist.

The location is in the center of Malang town, the coffee taste was good, I like the panne pasta.
The place is not big but still comfortable tho

Nice ambience coffeeshop in town. Located in the middle of the city, and placed behind the building makes it less noisy because of the big street.
The building and interior is very nice and instagrammable.
The menu is quite nice and affordable. Overall it's great and probably wants to go there again"

Suka banget sama tata ruangnya, desain eksteriornya yg natural banget bikin pikiran bener2 fresh. Betah buat lama2 disini. Klo menu makanan minuman sih standar saja, ga ada yg istimewa tapi klo aku pribadi klo spot ini tuh memang lebih menjual ke sisi suasana tempat yg outdoor and natural.

Its exterior design is so natural, esthetic, clean, and so refreshing. So many water valves if you wanna wash your hands whenever you want. The parking is so large and spacy and FREE. I love the outdoor spots. The plants, the flowers are well-chosen and well-designed of course. The tables are made of wood but with special shape, called ""Lesung"", a big trunk which has a cavity that used to be used to pound paddy or rice in the oldtime by Javanese as a manual technic to grind the paddy into rice. The lamp stands are made of wood called ""Bajak/Luku"", a tool for plowing the field. The indoor spot has chairs and tables in ancient models. What kind of heritage in a hang out spot, loved it.

The foods and beverages are just ordinary like nothing special, but it is okay.

Overall, this place sells the spot and offers you a refreshing, heritage, and unforgettable moment.

Come, enjoy, and prove it!!

Easily got my 5 stars hehe, love the place, affordable price

I'd love kopassus and the serve is very perfect!

Overall I have a positive experience in this place and I really like it. Will visit again soon.

If you are looking for an authentic Japanese cuisines, I don't think this is the place. A relatively small cafe/ restaurant that has its own dedicated coffee bar and it is known for its delicious rice bowl. The ramen there is standard, it is not that delicious but it is not bad either. Overall, the place is clean, customer service is standard, it has a nice calming vibe, price is a bit expensive but it is still reasonable. Just a good place to chill and eat rice bowls after quarantine :)

(i went there before the COVID-19 )

Small cafe at san antonio shopping street, Pakuwon City, East Surabaya. Nice interior. But slow service and the staffs can be improved.

Recomended are crispy pork don, gyudon, gyutandon.

The food is good! The place is a bit small, but quite homey. Parking space is huge since fukudon is a part of the san antonio shopping street.

Minimalistic and modern themed restaurant and you won't think their main menu is rice bowl. Ordered Oyakodon and their signature iced coffee. The oyakodon tastes burnt and dry, literally wrong all over. My cousin ordered the wagyu don and it tastes very good, so I don't know why the oyakodon tasted like that. Their signature iced coffee is hella good though. Highly recommended"

As for drink... I ordered artisan tea...cold...here come the not so good part... The tea is not hot (maybe since i ordered iced) but you get crystall sugar... How on  earth you mix sugar (crystall) on warm tend to cold tea..?? At least give us liquid sugar...
Well that's it...only there for 15min... The ambience iso not that comfort

The newest Starbucks in town, and the first Starbucks which provides drive thru in Malang. If you want to dine-in, don't worry. It's really spacious. The location is not really difficult to find. Let's say it's in the main road in Malang.

Located somewhere in rural areas of Malang surrounded by trees and only a few people passing by, it definitely feels like you just sipping coffee in some kind of forest or someone's backyard. üòÅüçÉ

Coffee taste decent. Too bad they have a very limited options for food. But still a good option if you want to escape the city loud noise.

Lovely and quiet place. The staffs are friendly, the price is affordable. You should try their Es Rempah.

They make you feel's like home!  Quite place for escape from crowd for a moment.  They also will serve you with a nice coffee,  sweet smile and with happiness.

It's a very refreshing place. With bamboo trees at the side of this ""Tiny House"",  located at shaded place, this Coffee Shop, certainly could make you relax. Furthermore, they serve a great quality of coffee (oh, and there's chocolate too). The hospitality from the owner, too, makes this place a great place to go. Make your moments in here!

Their single origin were aces, limited choices for latte however, incredible service and hospitality in their own way, place is pretty hard to find on maps but you can just chat the owner and he will guide you through, open 10 am till 10 pm. Not a caffe but a coffee house, not meant for work since there's no wi fi, but isn't that what coffee means? To interact with people..

Places were mostly outdoors, shady when noon, and has incredible vibes on the afternoon.."

The usual milk coffee is fine though I must say the americano is very smooth, not bitter at all, no burn taste, a bit more on the creamy side, I do believe it's going to suit a lot of people.
Very clean interior, tables and chairs neatly arranged and doesn't make it feel cramped even if it isn't the most spacious. No restroom though, keep that in mind when buying seconds.

Cozy place, the beverage is quite cheap and delicious, and they got couple of board games that you and your friends can play together. Some book's are available to read also.

Simple yet elegant place even though it is a little bit cramped. It's designed for groups after all. Two places for our coffee, inside the building; which a cold place with 1 long table and several 2 seaters, and outside near the sidewalk with 3 seaters.

Famous with their Palm Sugar milk and coffee with the price range around 12-21K. To add, delicious and soft butter croissant for only 5K.
We can choose between hot or cold.

They have games too: Truth/Dare, UNO, Jenga, Monopoly, and surprisingly Congklak.

One room for improvement is to use glass, not plastic cups.

Homey is one word to describe this place since the the location is exactly inside a residential area. A tad bit too small to me, though.

The only thing missing was the cats, where are them??? I was looking forward to meeting the cats that's usually shown in their Instagram... Or maybe I just came at the wrong moment.

You should visit on Friday and order any beverage on the menu, they'll serve you one donut for free. And it taste amazing!

Cozy place to enjoy coffee, tea and the others snack. There are two areas, outdoor and indoor. Not too crowded. Wifi available. Both area are clean and wastafel available here.
When I was visited this place about a week a go (August 2021), they have a promo 50% discount one of the items that you buy If you already get covid-19 vaccinated. Worthy place to visit.

Find small cafe, and they worth to try, nice and comfortable

Dont like the decor. Drab and gloomy. Black coffee is bad. Even mcd coffee is much better. I'd avoid this cafe.

the employees are friendly, I ordered in the morning and still served friendly, unlike other coffee shops who doesn't seem friendly when customers come too early

Go here if you're looking for a 'hidden gem' cafe that has the soothing and greeny vibes because the music wasn't too loud and it has lots of plants, plus the location is quite distant from the main street.

Oh wow, what a hidden gem I found here in Malang.
I love their concept, it felt like you're visiting your frineds house and hanging out at their garden. The place is not crowded, the vibes are chill and the drinks are great. They provide a great coffee beans here, and the capucino were great! my fave!,
I tried some of their snacks as well, and Inlike the avocados one, surprisingly good, but I think they could only served several sets per day.

would def come back again (hopefully regulary)

‚ÄúHidden Gem‚Äù in Malang that Must-Visit for the one who loves Speciality Coffee and for those who loves to explore n appreciate good vibesüòÅ.

Amazing place to do meetings, WFA, and to unwind.

This experience, ordered the Arabica Bajawa Espresso + Cafe Latte
Also the Leuchtfeuer Coffee Costa Rica for the manual brew

Thank you for the experience and best wishes for Roewang Tamoe Coffee

Not exactly sure what is the hype, I know this place from social media and when I was there, sure the coffee is quite good. There are some bread and pastries which seems good.

The one that got my bad side was, since this place is in residential area there were some snack vendors going around the block. When I tried to buy snack from vendor (the coffee shop didnt have this snack and I was still buying their coffee and snacks) they straight up forbid me. I understand there is a ""no food from outside"" rule, but there were no other costomer inside and I always clean up before myself.

Homey coffee shop with retro vibes interior design. Served great coffee. Wanna comeback for sure."

Especially with smoking area located out of the building, having conversation can be challenging. The bright side is the site is very accessible.

Reasonable priced beverages. Nice place, good ambience. But too bad the milkshake I ordered was a bit too sweet. Located beside a main road of Malang so it's quite noisy. But overall, a good place to hang out.

Beautiful place, with very friendly and helpful staff on duty. For foreigners do spray mosquito repellant first as this place decorated with potted plants and trees, expect to donate a few ounces of your blood.

Price is considered normal for a cafe, give them a try if you are looking for a place to relax and gather photo content.

If you are a coffee addict, I suggest that you order a hand brew, about 4 beans profile for you to choose from. My feedback is that they consider upgrading their espresso machine and grinder for better shots and milk frothing. Not a fair comment maybe cause I have high expectations over espresso base coffee.

Service was excellent, very friendly staffs. Restroom was okay, but can be improved. Inside there was a vape store as well, but in a glass-separated room.

I was most impressed by their Furikake Karaage. To me, it tastes perfect--since I prefer sweet dish. I think it was worth the money. Meanwhile, their cafe latte is okay. Though I prefer another coffee shop's latte, Labore's is just fine. Lastly, I kinda like the vibe here with all black walls and furniture and it was not too crowded when I first visited the place.

This cafe is semi-outdoor and there's a rooftop! You can watch the birds, the streets, and the most exciting thing is you can watch the passing train!

That‚Äôs all hope this review helps

Actually its gonna be a late review cause i've been here for like a month ago. Ok next, so from my opinion is Sudut Coffee is just like others coffee shop startup like a plain concrete chair, small rock in the floor, you know what it is. But it is not a bad thing nor a good things. For the coffee its the same thing but here they serve their signature jamaican something i kind a forget, and i belive its mixed with some rum, but correct me if im wrong. The last things is the cookies which is good, i like it. Overall its okay for me.

Good place and cozy, the baverages taste good but nothing special, the price is standard

Coffee - conversations; or just online gaming with friends cannot be separated.  Sudut Coffee is one of the meeting points for students, workers, and colleagues who want to spend time together, or just doing task.  Sudut Coffee serves you with selected menu at affordable prices.  Wifi are available. An interesting offer is Morning Coffee-time, starts at 08.00 - 11.00 pm just for IDR 10.000,

good for doing stuff like homework/assignments, coffee time or spend some time with friends or loved ones. they need to separate between non smoking area and smoking area. because some of my friends are allergic with smoke"

There was once a small theme park located here. But now it's gone. Kinda sad, but sometimes everything has to fall apart to make ways for better things. Which I haven't found yet. Cheap? Maybe. Tasty? Not so much. Coffee? For that price, it's bad. I really wonder why this place is so popular.

The place is quite cozy and cool blended with a malang city atmosphere and adds a safe feeling when sitting and spending time there. There are so many open spaces to talk with friends. The drink also tastes good. Motorcycle parking cost Rp 2000.

An amicable and desolate (in a positive light) restaurant that is fitting for various purposes: large party occasions i.e. birthday parties and big lunch, friend group casual lounge, even private dates‚Äîyou name them.

This is a beautiful, quaint coffee house.  We walked here from our hotel but they also have a decent amount of parking for your car or motorbike.  They keep an eclectic mix of Indonesian tunes playing in the background.  We ordered the pisang goreng, brownie, green tea, water, and a Cold White Haze.  The pisang goreng is a delicious, sweet pastry type dish.  The green tea was delicious, and the Cold White Haze cold brew was a refreshing chocolate flavored cold coffee.  This place is a must try if you are in Malang.

Heritage yet modern interior combined with simple ""cafe style"" food and specialty coffee.  I tried ""Carara Cold White"" mix of americano and caramel syrup. It taste less bitter less sweet and fresh.

Great place to enjoy coffee, and have a snack.  Comfortable seating for gatherings with friends and family.  We can also buy coffee beans/powder produced by Kawisari.

couple month ago my frend tell me about coffe he bring from this shop and say ""the taste is nice and intruguing"" ..so today i visited this shop.. and ""yes"" it was..and ""more""..
this.. i think is proper benchmarks about coffe shop, not just coffe and place for hang around,  this place give proper combination about mood, vintage place, vintage coffe, proper serving attitude,  proper  knowledge, proper chat until hit your levels of coffe geeky-ness.
i stand to say this ""don't let your mind limited your curiosity just because intimidating aura of atmosphere"", the serving attitude in this place just sublime, is proper and nice to everyone..today i came with parfume ""reek de sweat"" and they just serving me with nice, good, kind of servings
so.... 10/10 stars for coffe shop , and serving attitude 20/10.

Iconic coffee place in the heritage area of kajoetangan.

The first ever coffee shop that uses flair to extract espresso drinks.
The Barista (might be the owner) made exceptional coffee.
Japanese Iced Tea was refreshing still with a little boldness
The cappuccino was smooth and perfect amount of foam.
To come here we kind of need to turn around about twice because we could not find it. It was hidden. Trust your google maps. and walk around the neighbourhood fro few minutes you will find it. But the parking here was quite a headache because there was no parking space for a car.
Hopefully they find more success and I get to visit here again. One of my regret from last visit to Batu was I only got to visit this coffee chop once because we have to leave the next day.
One of the things I will be excited to visit next time I'm in Batu will be this coffee shop (abundaces of amusement park, not so much)

They have lots of tea variant and you might want to check the menu first before going here since you'll be confused in deciding on one. But don't be afraid to ask the staff for recommendations, they will make sure to choose the tea mix that suits your taste. You can even customize one :) The best thing is that you can have refills if you're ordering the hot tea, best if you want to relax for quite a while in their homey garden with cats loitering around.

.. i kind a surprised today i am not took daily dose of caffeine.. and still enjoying this  ""sometime"" good feeling... this place wasn't kind of the place you found as fancy, famous around town, or give vintage vibes (is that young people say today), and feeling nuisance when people wandering around.. but this place its give you idea what you need when you being or traped as a adult...some piece of feeling that, someday you need place to calm and drifting away with (only) your sweet memory.... its wasn't only mood they give to me ..is whole ""pack"", food, drink, warm and welcome attitude so you stoping being uneasy if you come in alone. is nice"" home"" feeling i found as a gems experient. i  give 20/10 if that kind of ratings (i hope) really existed.
one thing i learn today.. make costumers feeling enjoy more important rather than give good scenery or ""vintage vibes"" (is that young people say today).

First of all, the tea is nice, totally indescribable. They've got around 20 kinds of tea (after eliminating around 20 more), and my favourite is Wishing Well tea. Hondj√© 2 looks amazing as well. Also, I do love the way the owner (idk who, a woman) explained each tea for us, it shows that this place wasn't build for money only, but with enthusiasm and dedication.

However, what makes me put 1 star down is because of the place isn't well managed. I understand that it's a place for folks or indie peeps, but I hope the place to be somewhat cleaner and more organized. It is aesthetic enough, I do love the place, it's like the calmest corner in the hectic Soekarno Hatta, but it will be much much better to organise it more.

Gonna come back soon anyway. Already need to purchase more tea bags! ü§ó

Tiny tea house, one of the tea shops in Malang city, they have a good variety of teas and very friendly service. Great job!

Comfy, homie, unique, recommend for you who wants to find tea üçµcafe instead of coffee ‚òï

I was very happy to visit this cafe. I personally think they start the first thematic cafe in small city like Mojokerto and they have nailed it. They have a very warm decoration which remaind me with home. The place is very comfortable and nice for hangout but the most important thing is they give us a taste that is very similiar with many famous cafe in big city like Surabaya. My recommended dish here is their chicken with spinach and enoki mushroom.

‚ñ™Nice place for chitchat with instagramable decoration.
‚ñ™The food is tasty, but just average for the drinks (especially the coffee).
‚ñ™Recommend the risol (only available in limited stock per day).
‚ñ™The price is quiet higher than usual cafe in Mojokerto.

Quite possibly the best place to eat out in Mojokerto. The food is on the higher end of the price scale, but with quality to match it. Everything tastes nice and delicious. The space is a bit cramped, though, unless eating outdoors.

Ordered from Gofood the price doesn't reflect the taste and the food quality because i got a very delicious pasta and burritos for a very reasonable price. i went to an Italian restaurant in malang before they have an Italian chef so the price is kinda little bit more expensive but i could compare the taste tbh so definitely worthy although i hope they can improve the burritos a little bit because there's too much sauce and i prefer them to be fresh with less or no sauce."

Unique cafe to gather with friends, only thing bothering is background music too crowded.

Their concept is out of the box. I like how they did their installations and bring the touch of Japan to Malang. Good food. Good ambience. A lot of choices to drink.

The place is not kids friendly, the food was good enough, I like the environment was like somewhere in Japan

The place for this restaurant is fun, and unique. Indeed, the location is not on the edge of the highway. It's located in an alley, go to the right, before kak ros' restaurant.

Nice

cheapest yet the most creamy coffee that i ever tasted.

One of the coffeeshops in Malang. The location is very strategic, close to campus. located on Jalan Raya Manunggal Sudimoro Malang City.

This place comes with an interesting concept. The place is also very spacious. Inside and to the side there are also flowers. The place is fun and very comfortable. There are indoor and outdoor areas which are both spacious and comfortable. Also there is an area above the 2nd floor which is very spacious.

The menu at this Coffeeshop varies both coffee and non-coffee and the prices are pocket-friendly. Good service. So for that, friends who want to drink coffee or hang out with friends. This place can be an option if you are in Malang.

I like the coffee, chill if I'm not mistaken (9/10)
Cookies (9/10) because it's fat and has chocolate filling in it
Churros with Tiramisu Sauce (9/10)
And my friend's cold drink I don't know how it tastes because I can't drink cold anymore
Instagrammable, friends
You can park the car in front of it or go a little further on the right side of the road, under a tree if you want it's better
The indoor place only has 4 separate tables, most of the others are outdoor but really shady during the day"

The price isn't too expensive, and don't forget to bring your own tumblers. They give u 20% discount for it. No more plastic or paper cup are wasted when u have coffee in this shop. Great chance to make better green environment.

Great place to study, the coffee and the the tea not so good. Service is kinda lacking, the server doesn't really want to answer questions. Not a place for you to come for the coffee, but just for study, with wifi and power outlets.

Alternate place you can find legendary milk product here (Nandhi Murni). The location is across Ganesha and Ketan Batu. Not so crowded than Ganesha.

Literally all Milk products available from Fresh Milk , to Yoghurt & STMJ . Go try. I tried normal hot milk it was amazing.

They sell delicious fresh milk and yoghurt. You can bring it home or drink it here.

I prefer strawberry, mocha, green tea, and vanilla milk. Very crisp and delicious. While you enjoying the vibes of Batu city center, you can enjoy whether in hot or in cold. You can also order snacks here so it will be a perfect moment shared with your family or your loved ones."

Overall it‚Äôs a nice place to work, study, or even organization meeting since a lot of student come to this place for that.

The only minus two are the parking area is kinda small and the place is kinda hot although the ambience looks nice

Homey coffee shop just located in housing area. Feels like you drink your coffee inside your own house, even there's a shower in the toilet. There are three spot you can choose here, first is outside in front of the carport, second is inside the house and the third its gonna be the little back yard. The decoration pretty nice, and lovely. About the drinks and beverages, obviously there are a coffee based and non coffee based. I ordered a brahma which is like cranberry with a tonic water i belive, and its really refreshing. Also theres a potato wedges and chocolate toast that quite good. I love the potato wedges, theres like a delicious bolognese sauce. Overall its pretty great!

really enjoyed it, and there was a varied food and drink menu, the service was quite friendly, the room was very clean and comfortable. happy visiting ...

My aunt and uncle invited me to Foresthree. It seems like a nice place to hangout and chat with friends. There's a bunch of unique foods you can choose from their menu. I ordered a bowl of noodles. It tasted good, but I prefer their non-indonesian dishes.

The second time I came, I ordered Fettuccine Carbonara, and it tasted good. They have a pretty big variety of snacks or side dishes. They taste pretty good too. They have kind of small portions for an average main course, so if you're really hungry, you should order some snacks or side dishes to go with your meal.  The drinks are okay, but it's too sweet for my tastebuds. I would come here again with my friends, though. I recommend this place for hanging out with some friends or people.

The setup of this place is the reason behind those 5 stars. Food is good too.

Mbokambako,ChIJBwDfAAb81y0R_vdvBOLaric,"Jl. Raya Dukuh Kupang Barat No.21, Dukuh Kupang, Kec. Dukuhpakis, Surabaya, Jawa Timur 60225, Indonesia","cafe, food, store, point_of_interest, establishment",4.6,161,,"1. Product (3/5)
They offered not only coffee, but the non coffee edition, such as milk. For the drink, they have only one size drink on coffee and non coffee (milk) edition. I ordered the classic one, ice kopi susu Diskuupi and I think the coffee is too weak, too watery, I don't know if it's supposed to be like that or it's because of the ice melted. Maybe next time I'll order with less ice. But I really like the size of the coffee, because it's slightly a little bit more small than regular glass of coffee in the other cafe, so they can still offer a cheap glass of coffee and get a compatible profit.
For the snack, they offer fried tofu and french fries with 3 variant of powdered spices such as barbeque, cheese and spice. The snack is offered by 2 size, small and medium. I ordered the small french fries with barbeque spices. The size is quite big for the small french fries and it tastes very good.
Oh and the other snack is the sweet martabak, I don't ordered it so sadly I can't review it.
Oh and the last thing, I found a review that said they offered a dimsum, I want to order it but I don't find it today. Maybe they don't sell it anymore?
2. Price (5/5)
The price is quite cheap, with 16.000 rupiah for the kopi susu Diskuupi and I think they offer 1 menu which is just coffee with a little less than 16.000 rupiah. For the maximum price I think it's not more than 30.000 rupiah.
For the french fries it's is super duper worth it! I got the small french fries for 15.000 rupiah only and my tummy is full ü§£
3. Place (5/5)
The place is comfortable and cozy, they have indoor and outdoor table, can come in if you are alone or with a bunch of people. They offered 2 WiFi. The speed and the quality of the WiFi is good. They also have sink and toilet that you can use. I really like the ambience and the music in here!
Overall I'll recommend you to come in this place and I definitely will come back (but I will try another drink ü§£)

Simple place for drinking a cup of coffee and take a lil bit break after working.

Nice place to hangout guys!

Nice, quite, chill, and friendly waiter...

One of my favourite coffee shop in Malang. They occupy the same building as Inspired27, use Japan style coffee shop, I suppose. Below almost every table there are small compartment use for your bags and/or jacket, most people don't realise that tho. The prices are affordable, and I love their snacks. The ambience is quiet and nice (the one in third floor). They also have other outdoor space for smoking area in the ground area near parking spot, but I prefer the non-smoking one.
Free lemon water!

Suitable for people who want to working with your laptop. Good internet, with small space indoor, so it wont be loud and crowded. At night they also provide a outdoor seat for smoking area in the parking area, pretty crowded and not suitable to open your laptop.

Good place to take a break from the daily hustle and bustle of life, and enjoy a very gentle and variety types of coffees or other snacks here, highly recommended for you to visit this place, I am sure you will love this place and it will worth your visit, the proces are also moderate not expansive‚Ä¶

Simple. The price is enough to make you full without breaking your wallet, with the right taste. In my opinion, the chili sauce is not enough spicy kick for me who likes jarring spicy. But this can actually be made for people who want to eat it but not too spicy, because my friend wants to eat this, which unfortunately has a lot of the spiciness, he can't stand it and eats it so it's not enjoyable for him and people who can't handle spicy. So, for those who don't feel spicy enough, there's a whole chili just crushed in the mouth, it's as light as a firecracker for me. üòÇ

You know from a friend, I was a bit skeptical at first, sis, ""This is really the place to be?!?""
But it turns out, behind its appearance that looks like a warkop (and indeed a warkop wkwkwk), there is also providing delicious food, really awesome!!!!
The taste is great, nothing less, really more (beyond expectations, it's that delicious!!!)
The portion is just right, in my opinion, even though I only ordered a menu that used rice cake, it took a long time to fill up, and the side dishes weren't stingy at all (9 '-')9
Affordable, even cheaper, but not cheap wkwkwkwkwk
Just imagine, 11k creamy chicken!!! (usually I buy the 15k ehehehe, and I think it's already cheap, but it turns out there's something even cheaper!!!!)
The menu is not very varied, but everything is delicious + not boring (especially the food)
As for the drinks, there are lots of choices, the average is a sachet drink, but it's still delicious
Rarely hang out here, because...feel a bit unfriendly (very warkop vibes), but the food is super worth it!!!
That's why, usually the order is wrapped, but if you want to eat there too, actually just pw-pw yaa wkwkwk
The location is near campus, so the price is also very suitable for the budget of boarding students
Eat it on the spot or wrapped, it's both worth it, the taste doesn't change, and it's always warm :)
The packaging is also neat + the ladies and gentlemen who serve are super friendly wkwkwk

Nice and comfy place to relax

It seems that every time you go to Blora, you must stop by here, the right meeting point, spacious parking, lots of seats, the feel of an ancient Javanese kingdom. Betaj has been hanging out here for a long time. Prices are very friendly. Wedang and coffee are champions.

The most comfortable place to hang out, the beautiful atmosphere, far from the noise of motorbikes, the coffee is delicious, it's good, it's fresh, when it's just lifted, it's warm, the car park outside, the motorbike, parks in the middle, the garden is full, the atmosphere is full joglo, carving coffee, feels like at home, josss anyway

Omah Majapahit is one of the most recommended places to drink coffee and eat for those of you who live or visit Blora.

The classic feel that comes from the teak wood building and other ornaments really brings you back to the Majapahit era.

The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis place is probably about one hectare. If you visit you can take a seat in the place and angle that you want the most. You can sit on a teak chair, under a light bulb, on an iron chair or cross-legged. Everything will not reduce your comfort.

Besides that, you don't have to worry about the menu. Various menus are available here, ranging from coffee to various types. There are khotok, robusta and Vietnamese coffees as well as milk coffee. You can also order fruit juice or something. If you are hungry you can order food, chicken rice, egg sausage rice and so on. There are also snacks such as sausages, potatoes and others.

Oh yeah, don't worry, the prices are according to your pockets, starting from just 4 thousand."

The roof is made of tin, so it's quite hot where there are lots of students, but the service takes a long time, the value of the drinks is from 1 SMP 10, the problem is the taste of the coffee doesn't use boiling water.

Please make the service more friendly. There was a misunderstanding with the cashier about the order, but the cashier didn't explain it properly, instead he was stubborn.

fried noodles, boiled noodles, rainbow toast, cheese toast, roasted corn, taro pure milk ice, chocolate milkshake, ginger wedang, chocolate ice, warm orange

the service is okay, friendly and good too, maybe because it's a bit crowded, okay, for student pockets it's also worth it, but because it's a family here, it's okay, it's safe, and the location is next to the main road, so it's easy to find, that's okay , thankyou, success continues and maintain the service and taste

Roti Bakar Om Doel in Sawojajar, Malang is a place to eat that is worth a try for toast lovers. The price offered is very affordable, so you don't need to worry about spending a lot of money. The taste of the toast here is very delicious and satisfying, especially with the variety of toppings that you can choose according to your taste.

This dining area is also quite spacious and has a comfortable atmosphere, so it is perfect for enjoying toast with family or friends. Unfortunately, the service here is rather slow and unsatisfactory. However, this does not reduce the quality and taste of the toast offered.

In general, Roti Bakar Om Doel is a place to eat that is worth a try for toast lovers with affordable prices and delicious taste. However, there are still a number of things that need to be improved, such as rather long service."

So far so good

Disappointed with the service

Actually I really support businesses like this, developing local resources, opening up new business opportunities, but if you can give me suggestions, I've probably tried a lot of cafes, maybe dozens of cafes or coffee places in Batang and Pekalongan, because my hobby is trying new cafes My advice, yes, it's good to use local products, but the price doesn't match the quality, it has to be adjusted between the price of the place and the taste of the food, for example mineral water using local products, but in other places using products that are already national, the price is the same, then the ingredients other food. Yes, it's adjusted to the place where I'm sorry, it seems like this, at least when someone comes here, after he comes home, he'll think ""tomorrow invite friends to come back here ah"", not ""yes, just once, sorry, before this just a suggestion, hopefully in the future it will be even better and successful,

Located in the middle of a residential area with wide views of rice fields, it just adds to the pleasure of enjoying coffee under a clear sky. Coupled with the extent of the parking lot and there is a mosque to the left of the cafe, it is quite easy for visitors if they want to pray 5 times a day. I think this is a plus.

The coffee is pretty good even though the service is a little awkward but quick to respond. The cafe also plays music throughout the roofless space. Unfortunately I didn't have time to try other menus because I had to continue my journey back to Jakarta."

The most important
Now the menu is more complete, there are many food menus, such as batagor, dumplings, pempek (various variants), fried rice, fried and grilled chicken, fried and grilled fish, nyemek noodles and many others.
Likewise the drinks, which I can't mention one by one because there are so many

What is clear, the quality of the ingredients is good and the menu prices are relatively cheap

Cozy place, the service is fast and the waitress are all nice and welcoming.
Excelso got a wide selection of food and drinks.
The place itself is comfortable, the music was good, complimenting the decoration of the cafe, they got a smoking area as well at the front.

I dont really like this excelso outlet since it is inside a shopping mall but provide smoking area for customers, so when you first enter this coffee shop, you can easily smell cigarettes. The lighting is also a little bit dim. The wifi connection is not very good if you are working with laptops."

BEST PLACE FOR BREAKIE!!!
A must try in Jogja.  Their ""Tour De Truffle"" is currently my favorite eggs and toast combo. It consists of amazing soft scrambled eggs mixed with butter, cream and chives served with freshly toast!

If you want to eat the best waffles in the town, I believe this is the place that you need to visit. They always serve the waffles fresh off the iron. Nothing but fresh goodness here. And they are cheaper than the other places!

This place is a place with a balanced taste of food and coffee. When you love coffee and food at the same time and you hope these two don't disappoint, Agoge is the right choice.

Good taste, no parking area

The mint tea is delicious and very fresh. Ask for less sugar but still sweet. The place is small, you can't hang out, there are only long benches for sitting. The place is rather small but crowded because it is in the campus and boarding house area. The parking lot is a bit cramped on the road if it's just for motorbikes it's enough, for cars it's rather difficult

Drink shops with quite affordable prices, there are various kinds of variants ranging from fruit variant teas, fresh milk, and yakult mixes are also available.

Order the passion fruit tea, orange juice and Thai tea variants, request less sugar but still sweet. Maybe you can reduce the sugar content a bit.

For the passion fruit tea, it would be better if it had the original passion fruit pulp, so it would be fresher.

In terms of service, including fast, yes, the packaging is also okay

I like Glek's mint tea, the mint is quite strong...
But unfortunately it's bad... I ordered less sugar here... but it's still really sweet... it's like drinking sugar water... even though I asked for less sugar...

The coffee is admittedly somewhat nice. The milk is fresh and goes side by side with the coffee is a regular cup. It would be a star when it is served in a bottle, with a brand, in a fridge of a convenient store. The sugar was plenty to keep the older away. Yet the temperature is inviting for the white collars to slow down after work.
In conclusion, this place could have been better.

This place offers manual brew coffee with such affordable price. The place is nice, the people are welcome and humble. Great choice to have a good cup of coffee

This place is good for hangout or just for coffee break. Served various and best quality coffee. The price is affordable. Recommended üëåüëç

Vapestore top üî•

Good

Good place

It was the first time I went to a vape store in Malang, and my expression was WOW WOW WOW. Why? According to me:

1. The location factor, it's very comfortable here, the room is air-conditioned, the atmosphere is relaxed, the arrangement of the place is minimalist and neat so that it is ""eye-catching"" with the products being sold, but there are still minuses starting from the lack of seats so that it is less supportive for a place to hang out and share knowledge after buying a product or just sharing with the owner.

2. Service factor, TOP MARKOTOP, the owner is super friendly to me who is illiterate in ""vaping"", he still gives knowledge in a fun and easy to understand way, so I understand and am satisfied with the questions I asked the store owner, he too Patiently answering my questions, even though I actually understand a little.

3. Product factors and product prices, in this case I am still okay with the products being sold and offered to me, because the prices and products here are almost all vape stores selling what this shop sells, I haven't found any rare products being sold here or maybe I don't know which products are rare or not.

Conclusion:
I give this shop a score of 95 out of 100 because it's not from the location and product factors, but from the friendly and ""friendly"" service, I feel like I'm talking to my own friends

Suggestions and critics:
To store owners;
Please extend your store's opening hours so that customers who don't have time in the morning or afternoon can visit your store at any time.
Please add seats for customers so they can linger, the goal is to feel comfortable and be able to share knowledge with fellow vape users and with you as a shop owner.
If you have added a ""hanging out"" facility, don't forget to make it complete, provide soft drinks for your customers to buy, so that it will be more comfortable and crowded with customers.

That's all from me, thank you for your service

The only downside is that there's only a few electric plugs available if you want to use your laptop. If you got some friends with you, may I suggest to bring your own cable roll since there's a nice big table for a co-working space.

Toilets are also available and motorbike parking is also available. Can't park the car yet.

It's a pretty good place, what else is there a choice of where to sit or sit on a chair. Then there are also plugs on each table, so if at any time the battery is low, all you have to do is plug in the charger. The location is also very strategic on the edge of the Batu Malang alternative road.
The menu is also quite complete, but the drawback is in the parking lot, for now there really isn't a car park, maybe next time there will be a car park.

Located on Jl. Alternative Malang - Batu. The menu is quite varied with affordable prices. Toilet is small but clean. There is a sitting table. The atmosphere is calm and comfortable because it is next to a garden.

One of the best places to eat in Bali, and the ONLY one to make true empanadas Argentinian style!
Ambience is so relaxed and the attention is great, always with a smile and positivity.
Highly recommend!!

PS: Dulce de leche Ice cream is A MUST, you have to try it!!

Hands up for the empanadas & red wine from ‚ÄúNoches de Almazen‚Äù (event they organize some Saturdays night). We also tried the dulce de leche cheese cake and alfajores, and everything was delicious!
We took home to try beef milanesas, homemade ravioli, dulce de leche, dulce ice cream and alfajores, yerba mate with coconut (they also have with mint and ginseng). Everything looks good and the have lot of options more!
Thank you guys with you in Bali we don‚Äôt miss the Argentinian‚Äôs flavors so much! ü´∂üèª

The best Alfajores !!!! Service is really good and you can order your mate as well. I strongly recommend the sausages to bbq at home or the Milanesa to eat while you are here.
Hern√†n is the owner and normally is there greeting the people, super friendly!!!

My wife and I met 8 years ago studying abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina and have such fond memories of living there. We were obviously very excited when we found Alfajores Bali Cafe and realized we could eat Alfajores and Empanadas, and drink Mat√© here in Bali!

Everything there is excellent, and not just for ‚ÄúArgentine food in Bali‚Äù standards, but compared to some of the best we had while living in Argentina! The owner, Hern√†n, is very friendly and takes great pride in his restaurant and business.

My wife and I have been there many times, and needless to say, we will be returning a few more times before leaving Bali!"

Very cozy coffee shop. The architecture of the room is also very nice. Coupled with room knick-knacks. Very good and amazing. The dishes served are also varied. Ranging from hot to cold there are also. Books are also provided for bookworms. The place is clean. Very good and. Highly recommended for students, colleagues and others.

The place is nice, quiet, good for chatting and not noisy music because my concept is indeed a house made for a shop, but the number of seats is still modest but the menu and drinks are not inferior to other coffee shops. What's more, it's open 24 hours to hang out with your santuy, supported by classic decorations and poetry rhymes that can be the theme of conversation in the midst of gaps

The baristas are nice, sexy and nice to chat with.

It‚Äôs right in a ‚Äòhook‚Äô of the alley. It‚Äôs in the center of the tourist area.
- Vibe: The place is quiet because when I was visiting not many people there, but a little bit noisy from outside.
- Price: I would say it‚Äôs overprice. I ordered dark chocolate and fritter platter for 78k. But considering the location, no wonder.
- Service: the staff is nice, no issue.
- Food & Beverage: the iced dark chocolate was really nice, I like how the cashier worried it might not be sweet but turns out really good for my taste. The fritters is so-so and the portion is super duper small, haha. I forgot to take a pict of the food and drink, so can‚Äôt really tell how small it was.

Overall, it‚Äôs a nice and strategic location to meet or to have a quick rest/snack after take a walk, but me personally, need to think twice to come back there again.

Located in the heart of Malioboro. Various menu from indonesian and western. The foods are really good though little pricey. Cozy place and good service. I think i would come here in the near future.

Bad experience, ordered the Chicken Schnitzel and saw the meat being microwaved. When the food came out it was inedible with a rubber texture and rancid taste. We had no problems returning the food. Ordered a nasi goreng instead was okay nothing special.

This restaurant  at lobby Aveta  hotel  where we stay,The food  delicious  only the cake was a bit dry .

Drinking coffee at this shop feels like drinking coffee at a friend's house. Complete with chatter, chirps, splits, and snacks.

With a very affordable price, you could say the price of a friend, this coffee shop is worth a visit. Filter coffee/filter milk coffee which is Bung Andi's signature is also worth a try. The combination of coffee and milk is just right. Oh yeah, don't occasionally order anything, because the price is expensive ü§£

Open from 6 am, so you can drink coffee early in the morning or drink coffee in the evening while relaxing after a full day's work.....

It's my first time hanging out there.
It's a nice place to hang out even though it's noon.
The atmosphere is shady, there are mango trees that are quite shady which makes it a nice place to hang out during the day. There is a toilet too.
Far from the crowd, meaning not disturbed by the sound of passing vehicles.
This place is good for chatting not for playing cellphone games.

For contemporary coffee lovers, this coffee is suitable. The coffee is soft, delicious in the stomach, not too strong. The service is fast. The place is clean, here tends to take away, yes, the problem is that for drinking the seats are limited and the location on the sidewalk is not comfortable to eat in place. For a cheap price, let alone use shopeepay

For good coffee. The service is also really good, the place is nice to relax too. But for music, please turn it down, because for a coffee shop, the music is too big and the songs are not relevant, it's not a good place to chat with friends. So our voices talking will be loud at home with the sound of music. Music suggestions turn down the volume, and change the genre to a more slowly

The coffee is delicious and there are many variants so you don't get bored, the toast is really delicious, you know..

Chocolate ice and ham & cheese ropang are always a mainstay üëç"

LOVE PLACE BEST VIEWS

After not being here for a long time, I was surprised, it turned out that the cafe had been renovated in such a way. In the past this cafe was very simple with a sky roof and vines, now this cafe has turned into an aesthetic cafe with various ornaments. In the past, the outlets were only available at certain points, now the outlets are made evenly spread in almost every corner. The place is getting nicer and more comfortable, then the price is also still in the pocket of students. For the menu, then and now there have been many changes, even almost all of the menus are new menus. In the past, the heavy food menu was only indomie rice noodles, now the heavy food menu is quite varied and suitable to fill the stomach while enjoying the breeze in the afternoon. What I really miss about this place are the cute cats. There used to be a jet black village cat whose voice was very cute and made me miss. Yesterday when I visited again unfortunately did not meet the black cat. Really recommended this place

The place is comfortable. It is recommended to come here at night with friends. The most delicious place lesehannya. In addition to the availability of wifi, there is also a wall socket for those who want to charge their cellphones or laptops at the sitting area. You can read contemporary books at the cross-legged area and you can borrow a guitar or a card from the receptionist/cashier to play with friends."

For a lot of empty menus, there are always noodles. There are many noodle variants that you can choose the topping for.
I recommend Cwie Mie with gizzard liver topping because it tastes great.

There is a prayer room and lots of power outlets, perfect for assignments or work from a cafe. Parking is quite wide. There is a buy 1 get 1 forever at a very affordable price

The place has a lot of plugs suitable for assignments. Floor 1, floor 3 and the rooftop are quite quiet, the bustling is floor 2. The price is really cheap, but it's a shame when I came here, the pizza was running out. The green tea is sweet.

‚Ä¢ cafe with an industrial concept, but the 2nd floor is really dim
‚Ä¢ the ambience is suitable for those who like to work in cafes
‚Ä¢ the drink menu is 11 12 concept b1g1 looks like k*ps*ud but for larger sizes this swara anyway
‚Ä¢ The taste is good, even sweet in my opinion, but it's delicious, so it's not dominated by the bland taste of ice
‚Ä¢ For this pizza, I buy bread, so you don't have to expect a lot for 20 thousand pizzas, but it's not bad either

Very industrial atmosphere
Good food, fresh delicious ice
But it's a shame that smoking is allowed here, so it's 1 with a place to eat, it's a bit uncomfortable with that

Come here, want to try the drinks, buy 1 get 1 free, it turns out that it's the same as the others, 20k drinks get 1 coffee drink and 1 tea drink, the taste is quite ordinary. There is already a drink package on the menu (if you buy drink A, you will get free drink B) but I don't know whether you can choose other than the package on the menu

Suggestions for Swara maybe the drinks can be developed further, wifi can also be added on the rooftop, the indoor area has minimal ventilation so the room is quite stuffy"

In my opinion, this is the most affordable contemporary drink, Esque, it tastes good, the packaging is also good, don't forget that the price is also the most pocket-friendly, especially for students and college students. If you stop by, don't forget to try the Dark Choco, in my opinion, the winner. Anyway, if you go to Malang, don't forget to stop by Esque. Long live Esque!"

I feel SYAHDU ATMOSPHERE when I enjoy poor coarse coffee at the shop which is located in this small alley.

Because the location is inaccessible to vehicles, it's better to park on the side of the main road or in the main square.

Arriving at the location, we can choose whether we want to sit on the available benches & tables, or take a stool (plastic chair) and find our own seat along the aisle.

Even though the price of the black brewed coffee is affordable (Rp. 4,000), the taste is very authentic. The coffee tastes thick, according to my taste.

uh for the price? Don't worry, it's guaranteed to be really affordable, starting at 6,000-14,000 (hopefully my memory isn't wrong). for sure it won't drain the bag even if you order it repeatedly hehe.

flavor? even though the place seems very simple, it feels like it can really compete. lots of unique ones like Lowak Ice, I think it's because everyone will have a different review hehe.

Cafe with a very beautiful nuance, is perfect for being a place to calm the mind. The air in this Saungtani cafe is also fresh unlike in the city. Apart from that, the food and drink menu is also varied and what I like the most is the signature drink in this Saungtani cafe, namely Saungtani Batu Coffee.

Saungtani provides a relaxing atmosphere. Around Saungtani, there is still beautiful agricultural scenery. In Saungtani there is also a fish pond that can calm the mind. Apart from the surrounding scenery and the fish pond on the outside, the interior atmosphere of Saungtani is also quite comfortable. Sangtani provides a large enough space. Most of the chairs and tables are made of wood. The music presented by Saungtani is also quite comfortable for relaxed conditions.
The dishes and prices offered by Saungtani are quite friendly, pocket-friendly. As for the drink menu, apart from coffee, there are tea, chocolate and milk offerings. The food menu offered by Saungtani also varies, from snacks such as french fries, fried pentol, fried dumplings, to quite heavy meals such as instant noodles. The menu that I recommend when visiting this place is ginger milk. The ginger milk menu is perfect for drinking when in Saungtani. Apart from being healthy, this drink can also warm the body, considering that the temperature in the Saungtani area is relatively cold (because it is in a high area).
Saungtani parking area is quite wide. Saungtani also provides a rack to place a helmet so it doesn't get rained on or overheated.
The services provided by Saungtani are quite satisfactory.
The drawbacks of Saungtani (at the visit on 12 February 2021) is access to the toilet which is quite far away and has no roof. So, when we go to the toilet in the rain, we can get caught in the rain if we don't wear an umbrella or raincoat. The roof on the toilet was also found to be leaking. Hopefully this problem can be fixed at a later date.
Continued success for Saungtani!"

the beans used for manual brew is get from local area, occasionally they'll have a guest beans from far away...
the machine based coffee is somewhat lack in my personal opinion...
if you want a random surprise just say so to the barista, he's rather friendly for a new customer...
greatly recommended for those who seeks new companion and idle chat with someone new while take a sip from your glass...

The place is spacious with lots of benches and sockets that make beta to linger there. The wifi network is very smooth, the service there is also very friendly, the place is always clean and tidy, and the atmosphere cannot be used to make Mletik coffee an option to enjoy coffee while working or just chatting casually.
""Very recommended at a very friendly priceü§©ü§©ü§©""

meletik cafe is my favorite place in Malang, usually I go after sunset around six o'clock, I go with friends to do assignments there, usually I order noodles and drink milktea there are also lots of snacks and coffee either hot or cold, I like it the cafe is because the place is close to the boarding house and is also strategic but I don't like it because the cafe is mostly guys who hang out than girls

Have a nice and comfortable place to meet and interact with friends. The menu prices are cheap and the service is friendly, the opening hours are also until the early hours. Suitable for a cool hangout.

Nice place, nice coffee, fair price

For coffee orders from Lake Sentani, Sawojajar, learn to respect buyers, pay with money, you know, not leaves, it doesn't really work anymore. You don't have to queue but you wait for almost an hour, the food isn't given, until it's cold, only when asked is it just given. Well, no more apologies. Thank you for being so disappointing

One of the best pesenkopi for its taste from Pesenkopi Sigura-gura and Pesenkopi UM. It won't be enough for the taste. Best. Moreover, the Creamy Milk Coffee Flavor, the best bet.

This Warkop also provides a varied menu of food and drinks that can be enjoyed at affordable prices. Apart from that, this cafe is also a great place to hang out with friends.

However, there are also some drawbacks to hangout wifi stalls. The noise and crowds that occur there can make it difficult for people to concentrate on doing assignments or reading books.

Overall, Basman's wifi hangout stall is a pleasant place to spend time while enjoying a cup of coffee and free internet. However, you should still pay attention to the time spent there and not spend too much time just relaxing.

Nice ambience. Good food & coffee. Fair price

3 stars is too low but for 5 stars...Bhava definitely needs to work a lot more.

Having passed this place several times, I finally stepped in it last night.

Being seen from the road, Bhava seems cramped. In fact, it is a roomy corridor with warm lighting and nice match of colors. An array of 12 semi-industrial style table sets are neatly placed to accommodate couples or families indoor as well as 3 set for those who love it outdoor.

Having not so many items in the menu represents Bhava's dedication to the food taste and quality for customers' satisfaction.
Their food, indeed, indulge our tastebud surprisingly.

Yet, I have to be honest; serving speed is Bhava's weak point. While only one other table occupied by customers, a 30-minute wait for one of 4 meals in the order to appear is never good enough. If 4 of the tables are occupied by families simultaneously, the last to submit order may have to watch an empty table for 2 hours with growling tummy.
I believe this place can come up with better work rythm to compose more melodic eating experience.

Kouja is instagramable place for you to hang out and gathering with your friends. Has a photobooth. This place is also able to be a venue of the event.

Great new cafe with different concept

The location is a row of cafes.
The parking is wide.

It just seems unkempt. The location is in front of Sarijan Cafe. Very spacious inside, perfect for assignments and meetings.

If you say it's instagramable, in my opinion 7/10 depending on the motto, you have to have flat angels.

Service... it seems the staff is minimal, so it's not optimal, when I went there in the afternoon before maghrib. That's it, there's no food. Drinking is also limited. And the taste of the coffee is not worth the price. I feel like Nescafe ü§≠At that time I was a student and I was there. Why did he say this drink tastes like pop iceüòÖ

There are toilets and mushollah, just like that, I want to go to the toilet and the mushollah is really not clean, heaps of piles of gt. The toilets are clean, the mushollah needs to be cleaned especially for prayer.

If cleanliness is not maintained and the quality of the food is not improved, you are worried that you will go out of business, especially since there are so many cafes around that are much cleaner and cheaper and taste good.

Well, this place is not so spacious though. It's rather small for a cafe located downtown. But as long as you come at the right hours where the crowd is considerably minimum, then you will get a nice ambience instead. Meanwhile, as usual, I tried their latte. It was good enough. But their platter which consists of fried broccoli, kind of mushroom, potatl wedges and fried tofu was incredible. It's tasty and the sauce has some kind of unique sweet taste.

Visit this place after it got promoted by a local IG food reviewer. Nothing's special about this coffeeshop. Price are a bit expensive for that size of coffee. Dish needs forever to be served. Can't find a non-smoking table, unless those one outside.

I like the ambience, the drinks are great. I ordered strawberry creamy and ice coffee mantra. The strawberry creamy is basically like strawberry milk with the exact sweetness based on my likes. The ice coffee mantra, which is specialty in this cafe, but I think isn't special because the taste is like basic ice coffee milk *imo*.
The place is great for hang out with your friends, but not really great for those of you who want to be alone, because it's pretty crowded.

Location: 5/5 (easy to find.)
Place: 3/5 (great interior, I like the wall painting and painting in a frame, very creative. But I think, the cafe should put more ventilation, because sometimes customers are smoke in the indoor room. I found it pretty stuffy for indoor room)
Price: 4/5 (affordable prices according to the quality of the food)

Aesthetic place with limited menu to choose. Food is fair-priced considering the quantity and taste. Air circulation is problematic if you sit inside in a humid, hot weather and smoking area is basically everywhere. Waiter, cook, and barista are all very welcoming. Worth the visit with group of friends, but not intimate place for couples.

They have lots variants of foods, they even have instant noodles with katsu omg I love instant noodles so much‚ô•Ô∏è
Their katsu also thick enough, not that kind that has thicker dough than meat type, so it got very reasonable price with the taste and portion!

My kinda go-to coffeeshop. Not so crowded, affordable price for a quite good coffee, free parking. Not so much on the menu to offered, but I think it's just simple. Would love to have another visit to try their pastries.
Update : I tried their pastries. But I think I'd skip it next time.

A little coffe shop at Malang city. Worth to visit. Self roast coffee beans, roasted by its owner. There are Arabica and Robusta variety, which came from Pantan Terong, Lintong, Kenya, Wamena, also Kintamani, and others..

They have La Mian and also Rice Bowl for big menu. Pastry, Toast Bread, Friench Fries, and other elses for the snacks.

Friendly price, good service and wide parking space.

Delicious Lamian in town!! I didnt need to add soy sauce or chili sauce because the flavor is very umami. I ordered Mie Kuah Pangsit and Tahu Walik. The Tahu Walik is filled with real meatüíñ!. Unfortunately, I gave 4 stars because the service was very slow and they didn't clean the unused cutlery in my table until my food came (this isn't self service restaurant). So I ate my food while there was still unused cutlery in my table, I had to ask the waiter 2 times to take the unused cutlery.  Hope they'd improve the service quality better in the near future üòÅ

Nice and authentic place with natural view.
One of the cool places to eat to hang out and spend time with family or crush
This place was initiated and developed by the local community. The location is easy to reach, because it is located on the side of the highway.
Not far from the intersection of Taman Dayu Pandaan.
The air is cool especially if it's raining or drizzling while enjoying real coffee.
A wide variety of food and drink menus, at affordable prices.
There is a fish pond that adds to the beautiful scenery around. There is also a place to eat, or if you want to sit on a chair, you want it above or below, just choose the one that is comfortable for you. Regarding the safe distance between one place and another, don't worry, because health protocols are still being applied here, and the location is also wide.
Sinks and toilets are available along with hand washing soap. The parking area is also very spacious.
The service is good, friendly and fast.
In the vicinity, various kinds of plants are also sold, and the cooperative also sells handicrafts from the surrounding community.
So....you can come and look by your self to enjoy this place.

Another new branch of Kopi Janji Jiwa in Malang. It's not far from student life. The location is strategic because it is on the side of the road. Cool place for nongki-nongki. Free wifi. The facilities are okay and still very clean because the place is still new. For the same price, yes, like coffee, the promise of another soul. Yesterday there was an opening promo buy one get one free until March 5 2020. For the taste, this coffee is definitely delicious. Very good service and also very fast.

The concept is outdoor, the focus is more on local coffee variants. 69 is a possible powder code for some people. Suitable outdoors where there is a lot of wind.

drinking coffee, reading, discussing chatting to publishing books is possible, supported by UMKM TOKEN (blockchain waves), there is wifi too.

Local coffee 69 is highly recommended especially for friends who like coffee, the coffee here is very complete, the presentation is also unique. Not only coffee, there are also several traditional drinks available. What makes it even cooler, here we can drink coffee while reading books, because one of the owners is active in the publishing world. Books that have been published are displayed in the warkop to add an artistic impression. Not only books, here is also a gathering place for cyclists, many cyclists stop by for coffee when they are tired from cycling. the facilities here are also complete, for friends who like wifi, there is also wifi here üòÅ. The unique thing is that the menu prices here can be said to be below standard, very cheap, with the presentation and type of coffee that can be said to be of high quality, it is impossible for a coffee shop or cafe to sell a menu at the same price as local coffee 69. The only drawback may be promotion, the owner is not very active on social media, whereas in this technological era, social media is very effective for promotion.

Tasty little caf√© located directly next to the Ramayana Hotel (we stayed there but skipped the hotel breakfast in favour of this place almost every day). Full breakfast is possible with pork or beef bacon, sausage, eggs, etc. Or you can opt for a range of other options or pastries. They brew Lavazza, so their coffees are on the pricey side but worth it. Plus, their juices are all great and get me my servings of fruit and veggies, ha!

In short, recommended!

We've traveled through Bali for 3 weeks and haven't found a better club sandwich then this place!  They also have very nice pastry and delicious coffee compared to other places in Bali!

I came here when there was a promotion about high tea. There were not many option for high tea in Bali, so this was a good idea and I'm happy for deciding to go here because all the deserts were tasty. Service is good and the place was nice. Really comfy. Good job for opening the new branch, hopefully more people will find it. They are not visible from the main road, unfortunately."

Previously selling Tahwa, angsle and rounds around on a bicycle, now they have a shop.

Hot ginger menus such as takwa (soy porridge drenched in ginger water) and ronde (ginger nuts) have been my mainstays for a long time.

The menu offered by the tavern is currently quite varied, there are ginger-based menus such as ronde and takwa, as well as angsle and several other menus. In my opinion, the price is very affordable to save your body and soul that is cold in the city wind

*at first glance, the shop is sometimes not visible because the place where the shop rises up and is covered by a tree in front of the house

Including the one that's pretty good... With kick ginger later....

A coffee shop that uses quality raw materials, coffee beans used from the MOKHABIKA roaster. The syrup used is also from a well-known brand, namely MONIN. The espresso machine used is also quite good. The selling price of the coffee is very cheap.

You can get to this place because you got lost following the gmaps, so stop by. As for the place, it's quite easy to reach, the weather is cool, the cafe design is okay.
But apologize in advance, my honest review of the price is not suitable for students. The menu was less varied and I was confused about choosing a menu because my stomach didn't go well with coffee and chocolate. As a result, I ordered chocolate ice & baso aci. Baso aci at a price of 20 thousand that I ordered was too expensive because it wasn't worth the filling. But the chocolate ice is pretty good.
It is hoped that my review can be used as a consideration for evaluating this cafe so that in the future it can grow & be even better. Success alwaysüëåüèª

The place is pretty cozy, the arrangement is good. It's a shame the drinks are very, very lacking. There are only 2 kinds of coffee on the menu and it doesn't taste like coffee at all, maybe some kind of coffee-flavored powder drink and mostly water. It's a shame that a place as good as this is but the quality of taste is very lacking, it makes people give up on coming back. üôè

The place is cool, there are outdoor, indoor and semi-outdoor areas with views of the rice fields. The atmosphere is comfortable, the music playing is also suitable for relaxing. It can be used to get together or do chores. The design of the place is also fun for photos. Unfortunately there were several menus that weren't available when I arrived and the prices listed on the menu list were slightly different from the purchase receipt, maybe because they hadn't been updated.

The place is air-conditioned, comfortable for doing college assignments, if behind in the afternoon you can see two moments at once, namely sunset and sunrise

The place is nice, spacious, comfortable. Easy to find too. Service is quite friendly, food serving takes a long time.

Brown sugar milk tea is really delicious. Usually I don't like heavy drinks (sweet and lots of mixes) like this and prefer to just eat the topping for any type of drink with stuffing in it hehehe. But this one really made me finish the drink too. You can choose less sugar and various toppings. It's just that the price for the toppings is a bit pricey for lovers of the proportion of toppings 70%, drinks 30%, like me.

What is lacking here is cleanliness. For food it looks open even though it is arranged around the stove. So this is like an ingredient that is about to be cooked and is surrounded by flies.

Good to corn tasty

A shop that provides corn, some snacks and drinks. You can choose corn, if it's shaved the portion is a lot because 2 corns are shaved in 1 plate (price 14,000). If it's intact and you still have the handle, you can do that (Rp. 7,000), you just have to ask the mother. For corn flavor variants, there are original, spicy, sweet. You can also mix flavors like sweet and spicy. The corn is still young, so it feels soft. Eat while warm, delicious."

Cozy place

a quiet place to enjoy coffee during the day even though it's in the middle of the city (if there aren't many visitors of course hehehe) cool place and seats make you feel at home for a long time
the price is also friendly

In my personal opinion, the place is very comfortable, the atmosphere is calm, and it's also not noisy from vehicles, because the place that goes into a small road is even more comfortable.

It's perfect for quality time.

For the price, it's so so, it's not much different from the others, in terms of taste, it's okay. There is a choice of non-coffee coffee for drinks and snacks and heavy food, only noodles, right.

Really recommended if in my opinion those who are looking for a place for quality time.

it's really good, the place is quite cozy, the price for drinks is usually like cafes in general

Good

Actually in terms of location, this cafe already has advantages & wins a lot. But seen from several other sides there are a number of things that are a minus value.

The positives: the location is very strategic, in the heart of the city / main wooden protocol road, access & parking right on the edge of the main road. From here, it's easy to go anywhere & surrounded by complete public facilities (ATMs, shops, etc.).

What is inconvenient: access from the 1st floor to the 3rd floor which is steep & not recommended for the elderly & children, even teenagers have to be careful so they don't slip, especially while carrying trays of coffee & snacks. The view of the city from the balcony is also not optimal because it is blocked by cables & electricity poles which are very crowded.

For variations in the price of drinks & snacks, it's not bad for a cafe in the city center area, even though it's still a bit burdensome for school children's pockets. Btw, the delicious cheese bread makes you full & the chocolate ice is fresh.
Maybe that's all for now... hopefully in the future it will be even better 24/12/22

There are so many choices of drinks that I'm confused which one to choose hehe... finally decided to try the asian dolce latte coffe, the coffee taste is quite good but the sweetened condensed milk taste is too dominant, also try the peach & tropical mango lemonade, it's really fresh. for the service, it's really long, even though I only bought 2 glasses, I waited for about half an hour even though it was quiet

After my review above was read by the owner, the owner's response was very good and could accept my input openly, the service was very friendly and the speed of serving was really fast, I tried again at the newest branch in Lamongan Plaza, I tried the Thai tea, the taste The thai tea is really good, the taste is really good, the thai tea is just right, the matcha machiato is really good, it really tastes like matcha, try the strawberry sweety frappe too, the combination of strawberry and milk is just right but I think it's a bit sweet.

The drinks are better now, to be honest, I first opened here and didn't really like it, now it's delicious, the packaging is good, the place is also comfortable because it's cool and there's wifi too.

The portion is also medium, not too small/too big; just right.. My favorites are Choco milk and Brown sugar milk. Recommended.

TEA BREAK really deserves 5 stars from me! the place is really big and in my opinion the booth is the widest than the other drink stands. the employees are friendly. no one is jutek like that. really really fun. the cup seal is strong. I once bought a lot and until the house there is no leak at all. it still tastes good too. My favorite is the matcha milk variant! it's really good, it's cheap again. really don't disappoint. tea breaks also often hold giveaways, you know, friends.

There is one seat available to wait for your turn and the price is proportional to the taste. For those who want cheap snacks, you can choose the following snacks.

A sweet snack made from basic ingredients of wheat flour and eggs, it tastes crunchy
The sweet taste of the selected topping adds to the taste of the leker and crepes
Leker dough and crepes are the same so the taste is not different, only the size that makes the difference

The toast is delicious, which unexpectedly gets free iced tea and also a new menu. Must try!!! Guaranteed you won't regret it!!! The portion of the roasted rice is upgraded to a rather large size. Order the second time and still get free iced tea! Very delicious.

The best

The place is quite spacious, there are indoor, semi-outdoor and outdoor. There is a warmindo concept, choose noodles and toppings according to taste. Current food and drink menu, prices according to taste. The service system is also up to date using an alarm given by the cashier. Service is friendly and quite helpful. The place is also comfortable because it's not too noisy because it's not on the main road. Perfect for dating, casual office meetings, work, or just hanging out with friends. Oh yes, the motorbike parking space is adequate, but not so for cars. My advice is to come at night because it's not hot.

Lemoooot aka laaamaaa service ,,,, cooking I don't know if people are fasting ,,, just drink it, wait a really long time what else the food is taking so long like us it's time just to eat.

Had moved locations that were all in the south shifted to the north and which is now including the third time moving locations. 22 years hanging out here, only the generation of visitors is different, but there are also some old visitors who are still regular customers until now. The favorite menu is fried egg noodles using cheese and given a little gravy. Favorite drinks are still happy soda and iced coffee and milk. In the afternoon, it turns out that it is now being used as a place for storing motorbikes for the children of Sman 1 Blora. There are also many cafes around there

On Sunday evenings it's really crowded, but it's really suitable for hanging out casually eating indomie ahahahaha. Apart from that there are many other snacks ranging from toast, french fries, nuggets etc. The price is also still affordable, no need to be afraid to make dry bags. The seats are cross-legged, there is wifi so that you feel more comfortable hanging out. The place is in an alley but still easy to find.

Wow, this is a high school hangout place. It's perfect for nostalgia... The fried noodles are a winner. Now there are a lot of menus. The place is cool, sitting on the floor. Open it until night anyway. It's really good for hanging out especially when you're hungry in the middle of the night... The service is sat set... cool

Cheap prices and spacious place to fit many people. There are lots of menus with fried indomie and Godok in various flavors. The location is a bit deep but can still be found easily. Most Blora people know this place. suitable for hanging out with friends and girlfriends.

Like Cincau Station in general. Affordable prices with many flavors and delicious taste.

Drink recommendations for me other than the original ones are Honey Lime and Kahvi (if you want coffee)

The Cincau Station here does have its own indoor space apart from the outside foodcourt seating, but it's a bit small. Plus their queue is in front of the entrance, so if it's crowded, it's a bit difficult and seems crowded.

The food is delicious even though it's cheap, it's a shame the air conditioner isn't cold enough.

The prices are student prices. t4 it's quite comfortable but some of the wall decorations are starting to get dusty, the point is it's quite hanging out, it's cool enough for gathering there's a projector too, just right for watching soccer matches, not telenovelas hahaha.

The atmosphere of the cafe is quite good, it's just that the decoration is lacking. As for the food and drink, thank God it's delicious.

The service and view are good, but unfortunately there are a lot of empty menus so I'm disappointed because it's so far away that what I want isn't there. The taste of the coffee is ok but the taste of the steak is not satisfactory. There are lots of flies but the place is clean.
Hopefully the review helps other visitors and also the cafe so they can improve again
Of all the steak menus, there is only: smoked brisket steak
Then there are only snacks: grilled sausages and french fries
Then the toppoki menu etc. is all empty

The drink is fresh, what's more in the highlands it feels cooler, it's recommended to come here in the late afternoon so you can enjoy the sunset in the afternoon ü§ç‚ú®

The toilet is broken, there are lots of traffickers, the food is indomie n steak, 100 thousand.

It's a shame, the view is beautiful, the building is already good (but not taken care of) the investment must be very large.

I wish I paid more attention to the service and comfort of the cafe. And managed by an experienced cafe manager.
Will definitely go forward and last a long time."

The taste is good and the price is standard. Once I bought take away and it arrived at the boarding house, it turned out that there was no cheese, even though I ordered one with cheese. Finally the road again which has to pass through the river with a steep up and down road.

Banana snack is a must try really. It feels really good. Can be ordered online too. If you want to buy it directly, you can too. Road access is quite easy.

Crispy breaded bananas on the outside, sweet and soft bananas on the inside. Attractive packaging, the box is equipped with a fork and uses safety adhesive, neat. The contemporary topping tastes great. Macha green tea tastes really good plus chunks of delicious almonds. Chocomaltine tastes crunchy and chocolate melts on the tongue. Oreo topping is also delicious. All the kids like this. Order using the Gofood application and can pay using Gopay, there are discounts at this restaurant.

Because for Mimin, the cleanliness or aesthetics of the place to eat is also a mandatory thing for enjoying the food itself.

Next, for food, Mimin ordered Indomie carbonara and Boba pancakes. Mimin, first tell me about Indomie carbonara, so Indomie carbonara is a kind of Indomie noodle soup. Mimin thinks this uses Indomie curry, which is given milk and topped with eggs and ham. According to Mimin personally, based on the experience of eggs, there are a lot of gangs bubbling up, I'm sure you guys will be happy if you like eggs. But unfortunately when I ate the ham it was a bit sour.

The boba pancakes are really cute in terms of the plating, the boba isn't hard to chew either, but the problem is at the level of how soft the pancakes are, which according to Mimin, personally, is a bit lacking.

Continue drinking, Mimin when I was there ordered brown sugar boba and Regal milk. It's a favorite, if Mimin goes there, she will definitely order the drinks because they have delicious drinks too, according to Mimin. Moreover, the brown sugar boba is great

Not too noisy even though it's in the city, really comfortable for those who need their own space. The vibe is beautiful because there are lots of plants around it

The place is small but comfortable. The food and drinks are cheap and delicious. The venue is one with KopiTangku. So if you want an instagramable cafe-style spot, you can choose the indoor one at Tangku cafe, while the outdoor one is at Warung Ijo. The most favorite menu is the noodle dumplings. It's really cheap, only 10 thousand, but it doesn't taste cheap. It's delicious anyway. It is said that on Friday there is a half price promo.

The stall is very comfortable to talk and meet greetings, there is also a choice of hot and cold drinks, it's better if there is an additional variant of the breakfast menu (heavy food) that varies not only instant noodles.

The atmosphere is okay..the old gedongan house that I like..it's neat, beautiful, lots of plants, especially in the direction to the toilet..
Calm and cool..

The coffee served at the coffee shop ""PORTAL COFFEE MALANG"" is coffee from the Malang region. There are Arabica coffees such as Arjuno, Kawi, Parangtedjo, and Selorejo Dau. Then there is Robusta coffee which is a mainstay, namely SRIDONORETNO (DAMPIT) coffee.

Previously, Portal Coffee Malang was one location with The Roots Barbershop Malang. But now the two have moved to separate locations near the old place. The most favorite here is of course the processed coffee. In the afternoon, visitors can also see the coffee roasting process for themselves. There are various types of robusta and arabica coffee beans on offer. Starting from Malang local products and several other areas. Good preparations include palm sugar milk coffee, brewed coffee, V60, afogato, and others. For those who don't like coffee, there are choices of traditional drinks such as wedang uwuh, nasi kencur and turmeric tamarind. Quality and taste to be reckoned with."

Service top

Hands down one of the most comfortable coffeeshops in Malang. Even though the location is not too close to the Soehat area, it turns out that the trip there is worth it.

First, you see the building looks like a vintage house, but overall it looks neat, the combination with the furniture which is dominated by wood, fits perfectly. It feels cool and homey, especially the area isn't too crowded, so you can feel calm.

Try ordering the Japanese brew and heavy food. Make the coffee just right and make it proper, following the barista's advice for the choice of beans, and it turns out to be exactly according to taste. There are many drink menu choices, whether you want coffee or non-coffee.

For food, you can order curry rice, this one is special. I myself don't often order heavy food at coffeeshops in Malang, but here it really is, the food is delicious. The curry is really good, even though it's not too thick but the taste itself is delicious. Plus there is katsu which is big in size and rice which seems to be in the panfry again so it has a taste. The food combination is really delicious, guaranteed not to regret it. And the portions are huge for the price. For now it's a favorite curry in Malang, you can even find something unique in a coffee shop. There are also several kinds of heavy food and all of them are interesting, of course I will try the others on my next visit.

The service is also very friendly and quite good, can also provide an explanation regarding the food and drinks that we will order, where a brief description is also given on the menu.

The seating area consists of indoor, semi-outdoor and outdoor. I myself sat in the semi-outdoor patio area near the bar. There are also plugs available so that it is suitable for working while drinking coffee and eating. The smoking area is in the outdoor near the parking lot. The seats themselves aren't that many, but considering the proportions to the build, they're just right.

Additional facilities such as wifi are also available, there are also toilets.

Parking for cars is in front of the coffeeshop while motorbikes are in the side area, enough to accommodate visitors.

Overall, it's really nice to have coffee in a quite different area, a quiet area. Suitable for work while enjoying coffee. Plus, the food is delicious, this is really a plus, so you don't have to bother moving places to eat. Make sure to include the list of coffeeshops that you will visit!"

Nice vibes

Found this warkop by accident when passing through Cor Jesu. It turns out to be a humble and nice place to chat. There are several types of drinks and the prices are still affordable. Plus on weekends you can have morning coffee here, interesting!

If by chance it's late and you are looking for a place to drink coffee or tea, you can come here, especially after the rain it is suitable to cover and drink warm drinks here.

For the drinks themselves, there is coffee, and quite a wide selection of teas. I personally think the selection of teas is quite unique and worth trying all of them. I tried the milk tea myself and it's quite suitable for the taste, maybe next time I'll ask for the level of sweetness to be reduced. Then had time to try the lemon grass eggplant. Unique, warm, and fresh, that's the description. Perfect for accompanying the evenings after the rain.

For food there are some snacks that can accompany your cup of coffee or tea, please check what's available.

As for the seats themselves on the side of the road around this warkop area, there are quite a lot of chairs, so don't worry about not getting a place. Likewise, the parking area is also wide and guarded by parking officers, safe.

The coffeeshop itself is only a building for the bar area. And in my opinion, the arrangement is really neat, starting from the decoration with retro items, then the arrangement of the tea jars and tools is neat, it's nice to see. It also makes you feel at home looking at the bar and then seeing the crowd around. Accompanied by the sound of the street. The point is serene.

Overall a fun place, always happy to stop by a place like this. Immediately put it on the list of warkop that are worth going to!

Ordered cookie but it never came and we couldn‚Äôt be bothered to remind the staff, so in the end it was simply cancelled.

Kurang recommended ya kl bawa anak2.. karna most of visitors nya pasti ngrokok atau ga at least nge sisha.
Harga sesuai dg pelayanan yg diberikan + menu yg disajikan.

A friend recommended Awal Bermula Cafe and Eatery. At first I did not have much expectation, but after my visit I can say that it is a perfect spot to hang-out with friends, work on your computer or simply enjoy a plate of snack and drink.
Even though Awal Bermula is located on a busy street, across Pasar Blimbing, once you are inside, it is quiet. Their food and drink were okay (between 20-30K). It also has some seatings on the 2nd floor.
One major turn-off is parking. Parking space is tiny, fit two cars and two/three motorcycles or six motorcycles. Take ride-hailing service will save you from headache.

The beverages is good, the vibe in such a place is amazing for a dinner and chill time. Customer can enjoy the view from above to the road

The place is very comfortable clean and also seems simple not a fancy cafe. The coffee menu is very diverse and is also served from various coffee beans that we can choose for ourselves. For the price, it is still standard in the class of cafe cafes that sell contemporary coffee.

But yesterday when I ordered manual brew v60, the taste of the coffee was still lacking in my opinion, either because the coffee beans were not fresh, or something else that I didn't know.

There are quite a lot of choices, ranging from bread to rice. The portion is also not bad, you could say it's a lot, but it's quite full. The dessert choices are also many and really delicious! Starting from warm to cold. The waffles make you want to come back again, especially with added ice cream. The concept is also cute, you can see it from the location, menu names and food presentation. So the food and drinks are quite Instagram-able, definitely something that we're looking for, right? Not to mention the decorations that can be used as a place for photographs. It's a good place to hang out with friends or hang out with your partner, because there's also musical entertainment here. Eat well without a broken bag. Unfortunately, because of its location in a residential area, it's difficult to park if you bring a car. For motorbikes, I think it's quite safe, because there is a motorbike parking space. Now it's difficult to bring a car, because usually there are already cars around the owner of the house parked in front of his house. So the consideration is that if you go there, always look for a quiet hour or day, because you are sure that it will be difficult to find a parking space. But I'm sure you will come back and come back again.

The place is very instagramable, the atmosphere is comfortable, the menu is recommended, it's up to date, the bananalab is the best, the menu is inspiring, there's rokupang, there's taichan meatballs, the taste is delicious, the spiciness can also be requested, the price is affordable, the packaging is intended. For those who are lazy, especially if you can order on the gojek app, it's great..

Very clean place to eat and hang out. The drink menu is really fresh, because it uses pure milk, especially the yakult based one, it's really good on hot and hot days. The food menu is also good, for those who like spicy, you have to go here, this food lab is boss, not canned sardines ü§£"

It is a nice and home-like coffee shop with very friendly crews. The foods are great, the beverages are delightful too.

great heritage architecture

Cozy coffee shop/cafe in Malang

The ambiance at Golden Sand is comfortable, warm and calm. Interior design is also suitable to be combined with buildings that are indeed Dutch heritage.

For food, the portions and prices are standard and reasonable. As for the taste, it's also delicious, there's nothing to complain about.

Waiter service is also very friendly and smiling. Big applause for the waiter and the barista.

My only complaint might be the different prices between the menu and those on the bill, for some foods the price can go up 10-25k from what is on the menu book. For drinks, it can actually be 2-5k cheaper than the menu book. Maybe the menu book can be updated so that customers can be more comfortable.

Overall, still a great place, great food and great ambiance. Will I come back here? Of course! The comfortable atmosphere succeeds in making me want to come back to taste other dishes. But for now 4 stars first, if there is improvement in the future, 5 stars for sure!

The place is quiet, open and comfortable. Suitable for those who don't like crowds, especially during the pandemic era. Standard food and drink prices. The menu is still not very extensive, but quite varied. The taste of the food is pretty good. Provides several games that can be played with friends/family"

For a comfortable, cozy place, it's nice to relax and be more elegant. There is a meeting room too.

To drink it, I ordered the V60, for the initial taste, the balance is okay, but after the taste, it still bothers your throat. It's okay, practice more, mas and miss barista.
The service is also okay, friendly.

Available smoking room, non-smoking room, meeting room and outdoor can be selected as needed. The menu includes coffee, non-coffee, snacks and even heavy meals.

If only there is another cafe here at Gubeng Lama, I would never come to this cafe. First, the waitress is NOT FRIENDLY AT ALL. She looks grumpy since the first time I arrived, made and order until the payment process. At this stage, I felt not welcome. Second, I need to wait quite long until my order arrived, it's a pity since I just ordered coffee latte and french fries which usually it doesn't take that long. So, again I felt disappointed. Third, my comment goes to the things I ordered. Voila, finally the coffee latte and the french fries arrived at my table. And you know what? The coffee latte was super sweet! It's no more taste like coffee but like melted sugar instead. I got more and more disappointed when I look at the french fries. Oh man! I even not sure if I can call that as a french fries. It's terrible! And the climax was when I am making the payment. For such a terrible service and food, I got to pay A LOT! Oh man, I have no words to express how disappointed I am to have such experience at this cafe. If there is another option to rate this cafe, I would definitely choose HALF STAR or even MINUS one. ONE star is too good after all that I have experienced.

I really hope that the management could make a deep evaluation and commit to give a way better service to its customer. Hopefully, I am the last person who had this terrible experience and none will experience this in the future.

For a place it's really good to hang out, free parking. Prices are almost the same as other cafes.
For TWG's original menu, there are a few variations, unfortunately heavy food such as noodles, penyetan etc. are not originally made by TWG, because I was suspicious of the plate, after asking the employee, yes, it was true that it was from the stall across the street. Even if you take it from the opposite stall, the packaging is made at cafe level, not like eating at a food stall.

The place is interesting for those who don't really like crowds, the snack menu is less varied.

The price of coffee is cheap, the snacks are also cheap, the Wi-Fi is fast. Because of that this place is favored by many school children. Especially those who like to play mobile games. Not the right place if you are a person who prioritizes coffee taste. Coffee is perfunctory, but still very suitable for an affordable price.

STMJ is the center of the city when you want to wander around at night, serving food besides STMJ and Ronde.

It's special here if you want to drink wedang an, the STMJ has a patent.. Syegeerr rek.

The snacks also have various satay.
If you want to eat heavy, you can order fried duck here.

Judging from the parking lot, the Coffe Center has a large parking area, the front area is used for cars and the side area for motorcycles.

For drinks, there are tea-based, non-coffee and coffee. I ordered Popuko and Red Velvet. For Popuko syrup, it's not too sweet, so the copy flavor still wins, for Red Velvet, the taste is dominantly sweet.

Go to Malang. Stop by for a coffee at Madrid Cafe.
There are various flavors ranging from local Malang coffee, dampit coffee, robusta coffee and many others.
Seats such as cafes are generally made of wood, adding to the impression of elegance and dynamics.
Susana can be said to be cool compared to the scorching heat of the sun on the way. Hehe,
This view is ok.
Anyway, it's suitable if after a traffic jam on the way to Malang, stop at this place.

Dizzy Coffee.. French Fries IDR 10,000 But PORTIONS ARE MALANG RAYA CHAMPIONS

Wow, I never thought that in the Ciliwung area, Malang, there is really good coffee..

Product: I ordered Es Coffee Coconut, it tasted really good... my friend, who doesn't like coffee that much, took a sip and immediately said ""mmmm yummmm"". That means it's really good because my friend is the most fussy about food and drink.

Price: the price is standard but in accordance with the taste. The price for Ice Coffee Coconut is only IDR 18,000, guys.. French fries are only IDR 10,000 but the portion, Masha Allah, is a lot, guys, and the taste is really good too...

Place: even though I ordered take away but at first glance I saw that the place was quite comfortable for hanging out... and the location is on the side of the road so it's really easy to find.

Service: friendly service, even though I came with flip flops and all black clothes..

Please, those who miss good coffee can immediately attack the place....

The drinks are great

The place is difficult to find a car park. Very roadside location.

For the price, it's still above the lower limit for cafe prices in Malang, yes, but it's worth it because the place is good, bro, the coffee is also good. Price range if I'm not mistaken 15k-30s

The atmosphere is calm even though the roadside is a bit congested and almost always crowded, especially near gacoan, you know how to do gacoan for yourself

The only minus is the space, which is not too big and not too small, while the plus is that there is an individual seat facing the wall. The seats are actually proportional to the overall space, but I personally think it's a bit too small.

The majority of seats are outdoor, indoor non smoking only 1 seat set, I guess.

The service is a little above standard which is good because the standard is actually already good. If you pay using QRIS (QR Code), the qr code is printed specifically for customer transactions, so you don't need to enter a nominal again like in most cafes today.

Thanks for the experience

So-so.. small place, less parking, really standard coffee.. The image of the Capucinno lgs disappears before you drink it and it's not hot at all"

Located at the extension of the mall (?). The staff was nice. The cheese tea was good

There are many different variants of this, from coffee, fruit, original, chocolate flavors with prices starting from 15k to 27k. There are two types of sizes, small or medium. For the taste yesterday, I tried the avocado coffe machiato, the taste is delicious, not to much sweetness, the ice isn't too much, the avocado and coffee are ngbland. The service is fast, you don't have to wait long.

Located on the 3rd floor of Malioboro Mall, in the new food court area. The place is quite behind near the escalator down.

I've been hanging out here since I graduated from school.. it's cheap.. it tastes good..

The location is near a school so it's quite strategic and it's still in the city. Even though the place is relatively small, the arrangement is neat so it's still comfortable.
As for the taste, it's really delicious, the taste is similar to the place where it comes from (according to the name of the cafe) especially when eating when it's raining is definitely more delicious... So I miss going to Bandung again
Eheheh

The seblak is really cheap, but it's a shame it's very different from the original recipe, please fix the recipe, the portions and the fried stuffing feels like a rock hurts when you bite üòÇ

-Tea Bar Leaves-

Bored with hanging out at the coffee shop, so you can shift to the tea shop. The tea here is not just any tea. The taste is very unique, it is made directly so it is guaranteed to taste fresh and distinctive. You can really request if you want sweet or sour. The price is also very affordable, from 15-25 depending on the taste variant. The stock is also sometimes empty, yes, because the seller is deliberately possible so that the original taste doesn't disappear and disappoints.

For me, who is enjoying tea for the first time, it's delicious, isn't it? Friendly and polite service. Parking is good for motorbikes. There are indoor and outdoor. Very close to the highway. Comfortable seating both inside and out. Toilets are also clean. It's cool to just sit and enjoy tea alone or with friends and family.

Thirst savior drink with various variants of processed tea and fruit drinks.

In my opinion, the most recommended are Jasmine Hibiscus and their Mogu-Mogu Tea. So refreshing!

Apart from drinks, there is now a food menu and side dishes such as chicken katsu, corn dogs and home made brownies.

Often pass by but this is the first time stopping by and finally regretting why I didn't stop by yesterday
The drink is really delicious, fresh, can be an alternative if you are bored with coffee drinks, there are also many variants
The place is not too big but quite comfortable, clean too. The service is friendly & polite, recommended"

Coffee promises the soul of one of the coffee hits. In Malang there are several branches. There are various kinds of coffee such as milk coffee, chocolate, cocopresso, black coffee, soy matcha latte. There are also those without coffee such as matcha milk, yuzu yogurt, hojicha milk, grass jelly milk. For toppings, there are grass jelly, extra espresso, matcha ice cream, vanilla ice cream, pearl. Prices are standard with other places.

One of the modern coffee shop in Malang city. It is located on the 2nd floor of Malang Toen Square, right in the corner close to the time zone. The shop is quite small.

The food was amazing. Yes, it was a bit expensive but the portion was quite large and the taste was an absolute wonder. The vibe was nice and cozy despite its minimalist space. Don't worry, it wasn't overcrowded.

I love their pizza the most, they were thin and not overpowering. The vegan one was my all time favorite.

The only downside of this cafe is their lack of parking space, in which was a problem for the entire food business in that area. However, you can always park your car over the Marriot Hotel and walk a bit, crossing the street and viola! You are here!

Good place, strategic location, good vallet (free/pay as you like), affordable price, food is okay.

This afternoon, just for fun, I saw this coffee shop, just tried it for fun
The coffee taste is decent with manual brew, the prices are friendly, there is a top roof on the 2nd floor, you can see the Cawas road from above, it is located around the corner after dadi gets along next to the glasses shop
Unfortunately there is no car park because it is right on the side of the road and the table is not rocking, which is near the Barista's place.
If you are looking for coffee, it will be close, because I am a coffee lover

Pay attention to the music, it's really loud, it feels like you're watching a concert.

The eggs have been washed first. Every time I buy stmj, martabak, fried rice or all foods made from eggs, I usually don't wash the eggs first so that when cooking, the seller's hands hold the eggs which still have dirt on them. Maybe the reason is that eggs are not easy to stir. But whatever the reason, this of course affects the halalness of the food.
But here the eggs are clean, there is no adhering dirt. It means that the eggs here are holy and unclean. I'm sure STMJ Yassalam is guaranteed to be halal.

The location is at the Rooftop Hotel Namira near the Al Akbar Mosque, with a sunset view of the Al Akbar mosque and the toll road. This is really cool.

The menu is varied, there are snacks, there are various kinds of drinks too. It doesn't taste bad either.

To go to Kopi Rehat, all you have to do is enter the Namira Hotel Lobby, then take the elevator to the R Floor. There are indoor and outdoor rooms.

There is a toilet, there is a prayer room. Clean and comfortable. Good and Friendly Service.

I wish you more success and lots of visitors

it's delicious, for the price it's ok! what's more, being one with the hotel is really ok. favorite is the lychee tea! 15k tea is delicious! the lychee got 2! even though usually that price can only get 1 or nothing! but yesterday the lychees ran out huhu for a new snack, try the banana roll, and it's delicious! Yesterday I reqest using chocolate only! and for the price I forgot hehe!

Coffee break at Hotel Namira Syariah located on the roof top of the hotel. Another name is Gahwaji Sky Lounge restaurant.

The atmosphere is nice, it's cool to see the largest mosque in East Java right in front of your eyes.. the service is good and friendly.
The price is also affordable, even for the size of the hotel is fairly cheap. Love it.

SUPER RECOM spent the afternoon here, sunset in Surabaya, view of the Great Al Akbar Mosque and the toll road. it's above the Namira hotel, but the wind isn't too strong, it's very homey. and the most recommended is that the food and drinks are very cheap for the equivalent of a cafe in a hotel. will come back here again"

The restaurant was active in chat because the choice of chicken available was different from my notes. The sambal is really good. The rice is fluffier. Thank You. So I want to stop by there.

Ps. Thinwall, spoon and cup are mine.

eh, it's delicious.. after trying it because when there was a grab promo too.
The toast from before it was opened already smelled so good.
it's sparkling palm sugar ulalaaa

eh, the spiced chicken is really good, the seasoning is just right. the smell is very good. what's more.. the meat is soft and tender.. the crunchy dough is similar to the smell of buttermilk chicken duh, it's delicious. try it.

For noodles, it's standard 7/10. Overall okay. Repurchase? Yes

The most comfortable coffee shop in the city of Batu in my opinion. the place is clean, cozy, not too crowded, the place is not too passed by vehicles either. suitable for assignments or just chatting with friends, it feels like you don't want to go home.

The drinks and food are delicious.
For the 1st floor.
But the place is a little less clean.
Really comfortable, it's a shame the floor has lots of mud from sandals/shoes.
One song, a little table. So you can't hang out for a long time with friends.

Overall good recommended.

This shop is quieter than the others, but it's nice to be quieter. On the 2nd floor it's really okay, the 1st floor is a bit dirty because.

The last time I came here, there were no prayer room facilities, so I could look for a mosque around the cafe. Decent parking space for motorbikes, difficult for cars, and plus points because there is no parking attendant. The last time I came here, there was no wifi.

But not in tour travel, the price given is much lower than the price on the official hotel website or the marketplace price, which even though it offers a promotional code. I have tried buying all the needs of domestic hotels while on vacation on Java Island.

Well, I just paid then, even though it felt uncomfortable with his attitude.

1. Food is not good enough, all too salty. The prize is indeed cheaper than other cafes. But what if all the food is salty?

2. The playlists all have dangdut music at a very loud volume, even though cafes are usually synonymous with a Cozy atmosphere, not like a famous cake like this. NOT RECOMMENDED if someone works in a cafe/student who wants to do assignments. Because the discussion can't be so loud that the music is dizzy, I can't stand it for long.

bought at gofood, the packaging is quite unique, contemporary, tastes pretty good, the price is okay, reminds me of my childhood

For the StreetCoffee level, the price is quite affordable, maybe the seats need to be added. Using the CoffeeTruck concept makes this place a little different from the others. You can order lekker too, but I haven't tried the lekker, hehe. do you think it has entered online delivery? hmm

Lekernya ok

But the service was bad. The menu was variative, but the not all of them available. The price was also a little bit pricey. I was waiting about 30-60 minutes for each food to be served. Dan waktu bayar dengan uang 100rb, mereka tidak punya kembalian. Yang sangat disayangkan yaitu adanya live music tapi pembeli dipaksa untuk menyanyi padahal tidak mau menyanyi. Sampai dipanggil 3x, dan disuruh menyanyi ketika saya sedang makan. Saya kira itu kurang sopan. But overall, the food is average. Not too good, not too bad.

1. The place is spacious... good for gathering,
2. I just think the service is long..
3. The food menu varies, but only a few are available, aka many menus are not available.
4. For food, the taste is not bad, but the price is not suitable (a little expensive) with that taste..
5. Oh yeah, here you are forced to contribute songs (sing) even though not everyone is confident about singing..
6. The volume of the music is too loud, so you have to shout a little to chat with friends.

Hopefully it could be better..

the music is too loud, so it's not comfortable to chat, the rest is okay

comfortable place to hang out

Located in a place far from tourist boat rides. This warung is only suitable for casual chatting with friends, not for enjoying the beach.

There are some non-seasonal juices available, not too thick & a little ice cubes for each glass. There is a home bathroom without a door, although a little worried but it seems safe. Parking is charged by an invisible parking attendant (suddenly out - we take care, we also pay). The staff is friendly, smiling, well-dressed. The only thing that can be considered for coming back is the polite and friendly staff.

A cool place to hang out can be said to be an anti-mainstream hangout because it is very close to the beach. It is suitable to come in the morning or evening.

We were going to have ice cream each anyway, so why charge us first? Not welcoming at all so that‚Äôs your first impression. Then, When I started trying the flavours weren‚Äôt great but of course you‚Äôre pressured to have something now you‚Äôve paid! Some of the ‚Äúsorbet‚Äù aren‚Äôt actually sorbets and yoghurt based so DO taste before you just decide on your flavours! In the end I told the guy what kind of flavours I liked and he recommended the unlabelled ice creams they had which were nice.

Overall Did not like the system of paying first before tasting/knowing what you‚Äôd like , it‚Äôs very unwelcoming

The place is neat, their service was very nice, and the food are quite good for me. It is a recommended place for couple to have some nice chit chat. You can have some delicious authentic Italian gelato provided by Massimo Gelato, and there's 12 options of flavor you can choose. Besides, they also have many options for snacks like chicken wings, french fries, fried tofu, etc. If you want anything heavier, they got pizza and lasagna for you to choose.

Nice cafe n terrace balcony with city view.
Great taste

We went for dinner at Malio Terrace or Massimo Gelato called it whatever you want. Set up is really nice menu is diverse however the service literally did not exist. They don't clean and sanitised tables after customers only pick up the dirty plates and when you ask then fir help they say is a self service. The weird thing is that it is not that they do not have staff, they have plenty however they seem so disengaged and bored that is hard to even get thier attention.

Prices I might say is expensive as you can see from the photos of the menu posted by other customers.

Food is in the best case average, they have a buffet with local food however if you order noodles you will get dry packed egg noodles which is not even remotely close to  even the simple mie cart on the streets of Yogyakarta.

I personally had a burger which came a rare in best case medium rare they never asked my wife that order the burger what temperature I would like to have it. It will not be a problem if the burger was uneatable however I was struggling finding any good flavours while removing the pieces of raw meet between my teeth.
My wife asked them to change and they took it away, 3 minutes later I received my burger and for my surprise it was the same burger that I tried to eat earlier they just put it back in the grill burned it and send it back, let's not forget that when the waiter tried to serve my burger the patty fell on his tray and he tried to fix it with his fingers.

After realising it was the same burger the send tk me I went I request to be changed however it took me more than 5 minutes until I found someone that can speak English.

At the end the burger took more than 30 min to came again on the twentieth minute I just went and ask them to canceled the order by the time we were leaving on of the staff xame running after us with the take away.

I do not understand how one of the biggest hotels in Yogyakarta can tolerate such a service!!!

They serve indonesian foods like rawon,  soto ayam,  nasi goreng,  mie goreng,  bakso,  and aome snacks such as french fries,  fried tofu or tempe,  bakwan,  etc.

I ordered nasi goreng special.  It tasted different üòÇüòÖ
The first one was much better.

It's okay for cafe/resto at train station, little bit pricey, a lot of menus (rawon, ribs soup, fried duck, fried rice, etc)

Piece of advice for you: avoid this place if you want to find good n tasty food. Affordable foods are not here. Worst is, they do not put price tag on some foods on their menu list, and surprise you pay gargantuan at the casheer. By gargantuan, it means 2.5 times of price you pay for food on train (fried rice on train was 35K, here 85K-see the bill I post here). And that is insane!
That pricy beef fried rice is not special at all. Instead the beef, which served from the tail part, mixed with carcoal (residue from the grill I guess), stiff and challenge your jaw to chew it. And bonus: some fat,  that I suppose is not part of a cattle tail, is there too. If you wonder why I ate here, this is my second time in this station. I just jumped out my early morning train where I holed in for 7 hours straight and the least of food I could stuff myself before while I have to prepare for my next train to Jakarta. Meaning no chance to find more appropriate food (and food court) that serve rice, my primary food item.
So, even if you are foreigners whose advantage over currency rate, just find other places
[Indonesia] nasi goreng buntut yg saya makan di sini tidak se-spesial harganya yg wah üòì. Parahnya, harga makanan yg wah ini gak tercantum dalam daftar menunya. Kafe ini jelas bukan tujuan utk anda yg berkantong cekak, juga bukan utk yg nyari rasa. Termasuk juga buat turis2. Jadi, jika memang lapar dan butuh makan, cari di lain tempat.

Pak Ran's coffee is a legendary place from the time of the assistant work at Matahari PBS to the place where you skip high school, where you talk about arema, politics, complete household complaints in this place to be discussed. Our culture is not polite / friendly but coffee when gossiping is real wkwk

One of the coffee places that is thick with the local wisdom of the city of Malang. This place has been passed down for generations to generations of brewed coffee lovers. The menu choices are not adventurous. Black Coffee, Milk Coffee, Ginger Coffee and Tea. Some militant customers here sometimes refer to it as Kopi Hitam as Kopi Lanang, and Kopi Wedok as Kopi Susu.
For friends enjoying coffee, various traditional snacks are served such as brontak tofu, fried bananas, tempe mendoan, and gandos that will add to the enjoyment of your coffee.
There is an interesting myth about this coffee shop, if you are a coffee connoisseur who lives in Malang and has never stopped here, then don't expect you to be part of Malang's coffee culture.

The coffee is very good especially in the month of Ramadan üëåüëåüôåüôåüôå

Because it's in Panorama, which is located close to my housing (Sukodadi Residence), so if you go to Wagir, you always come here.

Initially, I never ate angkringan, because I was afraid that the taste of the food would be sweet, typical of Central Java. While your tongue is very East Java. But then I asked my friends to try it here, and it turned out delicious.

Nice place and coffee like home

The nuances of Europe, especially the Netherlands, are immediately felt as soon as you enter a cafe called Huize Jon Coffe. This cafe, which is located on Jl Majapahit, Malang City, carries a different theme compared to other cafes. The combination of Javanese and European nuances, especially the Netherlands, is very strong. From the outside, the modern feel of the building greets every visitor who enters the cafe. Meanwhile, when entering the inside of the cafe, a number of Javanese antique objects are immediately visible. A pair of statues of people dressed in traditional Javanese clothes immediately become an icon on the inside. On the inside of the cafe space, there is also a large Dutch language inscription ""Hartelijk Welkom on Malang. Huize Djon Geschickt Voor Het Maken Van Mooie Uitstapjes Gezzelige Sfeer Voor Iedere Gast"". The writing has the real meaning of Welcome to Malang. Several ancient European and Javanese ornaments, ranging from classic wall clocks made in Germany that are more than 75 years old, televisions, old radios, various leather puppets, classic photographs, to ancient carvings to decorate the sides of the cafe.
The Dutch nuance is also increasingly felt with the inscription in Dutch on the north side of the room, namely 'Uitsmijter Toast'. Uitsmijter itself is the name of a typical Dutch sandwich, while toast means toast.
For the menu offered at Huize Jon, there are various processed coffees such as Original Wine Robusta Coffe, Van Den Berg Wine Robusta Coffe, French Press, Americano, and several other processed coffees. However, for the superior menu at this place, visitors need to try the Dutch special Huize Jon coffe, which is Dutch coffee slightly adjusted to be suitable for consumption by the people of Malang. For menus other than coffee, there are several other choices, such as milkshakes, tea, chocolate, or even ginger. Apart from drinks, this place also provides a food menu, such as french fries, indomie, spring rolls, sandwiches, and several other menu choices written in Dutch, such as Gebakken aardappelen, Vleeskroketjes met mustard, Pannekoek, and various other choices.

Coffee shop that has old skool vibes. serves a variety of coffee and non-coffee drinks and other snacks at affordable prices.

Clean place, pin point map according to location, and there is lodging too.

Huize Jon Wine Coffee is the one you have to try!!
The ""Koffie Met Slagroem"" is also delicious but in my opinion too sweet.

The owner is friendly and likes to greet customers. Thank You

Jalan Tunjungan is getting more and more densely populated, what used to be busier for a long time, the Tunjungan market which almost collapsed is now starting to beat again. Shops, office buildings and houses that used to be left empty, are now starting to fill up one by one .

One of the new names that enliven Jl. Tunjungan is Ladeed Deli, located right next to the Hagakita bank building. This place offers Arabic-ish ready to eat meals, such as pita bread sandwiches, mandhi rice and kebabs.

I ordered Pita Chicken Shawarma & Oum Ali. The pita bread is fluffy, the vegetables are fresh, the chicken filling is well seasoned - menul"" and quite generous.

Cafe Located in the courtyard of the Harris Malang hotel. The atmosphere is comfortable, shady and quite calm. Suitable for relaxing for a while. Open to the public, without having to stay at the Harris Hotel. The cafe area carries a semi-outdoor theme, with plants that are shady and comfortable to live in when it's hot. The menu choices are quite varied, from coffee to frappe. For very limited food choices, I had time to try boiled instant noodles which was quite disappointing, because it was really just boiled noodles and eggs. For a class of contemporary cafes, the food presentation is very standard with the prices offered. The staff is friendly, and very helpful. Overall this cafe is comfortable, but needs some input for the menu offered.

Nice and calm atmosphere, the coffee is also good, the barista gives input according to what I want. The best chocolate! My kids love chocolate and cookies & cream. The family is very happy to see the many lights. Very good"

The pecel stall is very clean. The seller's mother is friendly. The pecel portion is just right, the taste is delicious. There are also other additional side dishes. It's right in front of the gas station.

This place sells pecel in the morning and STMJ in the evening. STMJ or a mixed drink of MILK, EGG, HONEY and GINGER is priced at a low price of only 12,000 Rupiah. Besides STMJ there is also a toast menu. It's a perfect match. Drink STMJ and Toast at night. For those of you who like half-cooked free-range chicken eggs, you can also order at this place. The location is also easy to find because it is on the side of the main road and is included in an area that is often passed by

The taste of ordinary pecel is delicious, there are a variety of side dishes and drinks. The food is fresh, the vegetables are fresh, the food looks clean and attractive. The price is affordable. I eat pecel with a side dish of skewered meat, the meat is delicious, I think the pecel is a little less salty, or maybe it's typical for pecel to be served like that.

It's really worth it bro. Pecel is close to UB. The taste is good although not the most delicious. With a price of 10k and quite filling. Very suitable for backpackers who are more economical spending. Oh yes, additional side dishes are also available at various prices but still cheap. The thick omelet is only 2k.

I feel very ironic seeing this one warkop place, because this place is used as a nest for students to skip school. Where should they study diligently and diligently but instead get tarnished because they play truant at this warkop. What amazes me is that those who are still wearing school uniforms are very casually enjoying a cigarette which they shouldn't do to set an example for their peers.

It may be a confused choice to have coffee and spend time around there because there are many choices. Oh yes, the minus here is that there are a lot of buskers at night, so you have to be prepared for a lot of change.

Nice. On the edge of the rice fields, unfortunately the fields are not visible because it is night. The coffee is bali and there is gayo. The price is according to the pocket, it doesn't break. Various snacks and there are noodles. Saturday night and Sunday night it's crowded.

The concept raised is monochrome (simple black and white).

The hangout location this time is on Jalan Kadaka. Very close to ""Provincial road"" Soekarno Hatta road, Malang. less than 5 minutes from the main road before reaching Dan's Kitchen.

Before entering, there is a sweetener on Dan's right and left wall designs that you can use to take pictures/selfies etc. In the form of flowers with a choice of beautiful colors.

The facilities provided are also quite complete. Free Wifi, AC room, toilet, prayer room and a representative parking lot as well as power plugs. Indoor and outdoor table options are also available. Whether you come with work friends or just the two of you with your loved ones, everything is facilitated at Dan's Kitchen.

The menu choices are very modern and friendly to students, which is the main target of Dan's kitchen. Heavy meals, snacks, soups and drinks are also quite diverse.

There is always something that can be improved at this hangout location, you can add a choice of delivery providers such as (go-jek, grab, etc.) and a pointer to a restaurant on the side of the road.

Thank you Dan's Kitchen for being the host this time.

Hopefully it will continue to be better and be able to add to the uniqueness of the culinary visit of the city of Malang"

The menu has many kinds,
The drinks have iced/hot tea, there is fresh milk, stmj etc., there is also coffee
The food has instant noodles and there is also a rice menu like at the Angkringan stall
.The location is near the city center and easily accessible, the parking lot is also wide both for motorbikes/cars.

A delicious and cheap coffee place accompanied by live music. Food and drinks other than coffee are also delicious, I like the sambal eel. Service is also friendly with a calm atmosphere. But please, if it carries the Beatles theme, the Beatles song should accompany it.

Cool hangout place. There are karaoke facilities here too. The choice of food and drinks is quite varied at very affordable prices."

Located near the Red Bridge, opposite the PTPN (PT Perkebunan Nusantara) building which is still very authentic and impressed by the Dutch building and close to the Prime Mister Bank whose building is still authentically Dutch. So it can be a photo-able place.

Here it is not only Angkringan Baladewa, along this angkringan there are other foods.

Maybe this is subjective from me, it's better if the spicy soy sauce is used as a seasoning when burning the food. So that it is more taste and delicious in its various burnt. There are various kinds of food such as skins, injuries, wings, intestines, sausages, and many more. But the owner's nephew said the best thing was the Nasi Bakar. The price is definitely affordable.

Maybe the drawback is that it is close to the river, so at night there are mosquitoes. It's not much, it's just there.

So what are you waiting for, come to this Baladewa Angkringan and try the Nasi Bakar.

It's really worth the place to hang out. The atmosphere is cool, clean and very comfortable.

It feels good. Hygienic place. And the most important thing is COMPLETE INTOLERANCE.

The place is okay, comfortable, suitable for young people to hang out. A variety of menus are served, starting from a fried rice menu, egg salad, to drinks such as tubruk kobi and matcha latte in the cafe.

Finally, I can taste Lampung Robusta Coffee and Lintong Arabica. it's boring, the problem is that Ijen always closes everywhere

Nice cafe, the coffee menu is pretty good at affordable prices. You can also buy coffee beans if you want to grind yourself at home. Like the lemon tea. If you are hungry while hanging out, here they also provide heavy menus such as crispy chicken steak, fresh vegetables and fried rice. Price? Affordable for students. I ordered a crispy chicken steak for only 16 thousand and got a more filling portion than the usual steak stalls. The chicken fried rice is also not bad, with 15 thousand you can already get Portugal (digger's portion) plus eggs and crackers, but the chicken steak is really a winner.

To taste ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Nb: it's a shame the anchovies aren't processed, they're just fried dry and sprinkled on them so there's still a bitter taste which I don't like.

A shop that provides menus with different flavors. The menu here has fried rice, fried noodles, etc. It's just that what makes it special is how to cook it using a charcoal stove, so it tastes better. If you come here, you must try the anchovy fried rice and anchovy fried noodles, highly recommended. Unfortunately the parking space here is not wide enough, so it's confusing if you take a car for example.

Not bad for treating the feeling of longing for nasgor areng from kediri. It's similar to Nasigor on Jalan Doho, Kediri, pretty good. The price is also cheap starting from 10 thousand. Try it

Cons: limited parking lots on weekends

Quick service, nice taste

H. Yusuf Jagung Bakar - a hangout place that is different from the others. This place has a mainstay menu of roasted corn and shaved corn.
The taste of the food provided varies, I personally like salted shaved corn. The place is quite spacious, can be used for hanging out dozens of people at once.
The downside of this place is that it doesn't provide wifi and sockets at every table.

Lots of hot snack menus. The roasted corn is okay. The ginger wedang lacks the taste of ginger, too much sugar. Spacious place, but not suitable for children

Pretty good. The combustion is uneven. It would be better if the combustion was evenly distributed over the entire surface. Reasonable"

The toast soul is delicious, it's a shame the sauce is a little small, the sauce has already been noted inside, but it's really a bit :(((( even though the promise of the soul toast is that much the sauce will be thick, this isn't huh. A little disappointed. The drinks are delicious, the price is right. Order the promo by gojek really a lot. Great. Just a suggestion, hopefully in the future there will be more sauce :))

The restaurant (employee) has no morals, cancels orders, there is no confirmation from a third party, the reason for not being able to get an order before entering the driver enters the restaurant 10 minutes before entering the driver..... please management, don't go around with yourself and profit yourself

The service was horrible. It was not even crowded and it takes 20m just to serve 2 coffe and need to wait another 10m for the cakes and bread. The staff worked super slow and ignored us and some other customers. Dont get trapped by the brand, others coffee shop in this mall could give u 100x better service than this branch of coffee bean

The services IS REALLY F-IN (rudely) horrible.. if youre sick and you only need a tea, dont bother to come here dear, coz it'll kill you about 20-30 mins, and THERE'S NO QUE AT ALL..

Opening soon coffee bean Dino mall jtp 3"

Then I ask again, is there toast? Nothing either.
Are there french fries? Nothing either.
Then explained that there were only burgers, cireng, and bananas. Finally, order cireng.

This coffee shop got a small indoor seating area and a big outdoor sitting area with a great garden and Local javanese furnitures.

Love it.

Order strawberry smoothies, chocolate cookies and milshake red velvet. The best one is the last one :-)

Cozy place. There are sockets and cell phone chargers that can be used for free. There are only drinks and croissants available here. Overall okay

The place is next to Huza batik. The store is small but you can sit outside and have a nice atmosphere. I ordered coffee + croissant. It tastes quite good and unfortunately when eating a croissant, only a plastic spoon is provided, so it's a bit difficult to eat because it's hard. The suggestion is to provide a knife as well.

Hello, bestie, meet again with me, today I want to review 404 cafes in Pekalongan. This coffee shop is located on Jalan H. Agus Salim No. 3 Klego Kec, East Pekalongan city of Pekalongan. The concept presented at this caffe is very unique bestie. From the outside, it looks like the small cafe is only in one black box, but behind the black box, there is a seat with a garden theme. Wow, a bestie who likes greenery or likes natural things will find comfort when she comes to that place and the bestie doesn't expect that there is a seat similar to the old house, duh, the concept of this cafe is so comfortable to just chat or bestie wants to tell a story.
For me, I like the natural concept the most because it's outdoors and not boring. Bestie also definitely didn't expect that it turned out to be a batik gallery next to it. Wow, the characteristics of Pekalongan are very revealing. Apart from that, the prayer room provided is also quite comfortable because I also like to stay in the prayer room for a long time. The model is similar to an ancient house with brown paint. It's really fun isn't it. Don't worry, bestie, the coffee that is served is also delicious, at that time I ordered Americano and well, for coffee fans, this caffe is quite recommended, especially for assignments. See you in the next review bestie."

It's great! The contents of the fruit also include a lot, even though the price is also cheap.
The mayonnaise and cheese are just right.
I haven't tried other menus yet, but next time I will order again here.
Highly recommended!

The best one is the durian soup fruit soup. The star who talked has not been able to take a photo

In the photo below, the fruit salad is no less fresh and the mayonnaise is original üëçüëç

the product is great. The fruit soup is really full of fruit. I've also tried durian soup, very good. The thick gravy really tastes like durian. The most important price is roadside prices. In cafes, it's probably 20k and above.

great. My favorite durian fruit soup. Good portion and taste. If in other places, with this portion the price is much more expensive. It's on gofood too

In my opinion, the most delicious and thick juice is in the fruitbar. unfortunately not many people know. only put in go food."

I was there with my friends and when we ordered her face was a bit awkward... but I give 5 stars because kamsia boba is very frequent do promos like that. You know very often, you know. So I suggest you check the Malang promo often so you know the promos for kamsia boba. The price starts from 18k if I'm not mistaken and the cup is really big. It's really wide. I like the chocolate variant the most!!!

The boba drink is delicious, but the seal on the lid is not strong, so one house is broken. :(

it really tastes like this is the best boba anyway. the price is not expensive but super delicious. the best one is the original brown sugar, I've tried other flavors but it's not great.. this is already delicious, the cheese is ok, the sweetness is just right.. instead of buying another brand which is already expensive, 20 thousand and above, it's not worth it, it's better to just buy this

40 thousand buy 2 get 1 free, cheap, the boba is delicious, it's just that the packaging pays more attention because the order via Gofood spilled a bit 2 cups, the original free one is also no less delicious than the taro boba, the sweetness doesn't disappear ""even I just want to finish it, it's a shame, coz the milk tastes fresh and delicious,

Nice clean place although not too big. Easy access to the side of the road, even though from the main road it doesn't look too much like an ordinary shophouse, later there are stairs below for access to nongki & to the swimming pool for the children. The view of the rice fields really likes it if there is a cafe with a view of nature that can be used for healing. Drinks & food are pretty standard prices from 10 thousand-25 thousand. The snack menu has a few choices, try adding union rings, chocolate cheese bananas, crispy tofu, medoan tempeh or cheese cassava. There is no VAT at this time. It's just a shame it opens at 3 in the afternoon. Lack of promotion on social media too. Try near the swimming pool, give a table and chairs with umbrellas like that üëç.

so no need to wait long.

really can.

But so far the texture is good. I tried thai tea flavor. Its better to eat it immediately, do not keep it in the fridge for too long. I spent IDR 26,000 for this by gofood.

Best siomay in town! Definitely will order again üòÅ

My favorite is tresleches Thai tea.. while my son likes the original tresleches (tastes like they have regal too). Most like to eat it frozen first in the freezer so it's like eating ice cream. But my child likes to eat it, waiting for it to be half liquid so that the texture of the milk comes out.
For Xiomay, thumbs up. 1 portion can be u.rame2 because the portion is quite large. The spicy sambal is addictive. The sauce is different from other dumplings (not red tomato sauce).

The xiomay is delicious and the size is big, the sambal is different from the others. The tres leches are also delicious, the texture is soft and not too sweet. The moortea is also delicious and the price is affordable. The service is fast and good. Good luck for the future!

The winter melon drink is the best... not too sweet and really fresh plus there are slices of super soft jelly... always a favorite since college days!!! Please open a branch in Sidoarjo!!!"

The satay can be grilled using sweet or spicy spices. The menu variants for rice and satay are less diverse. The place is okay, spacious, lots of tables and chairs.
I'm just a little disappointed with the cashiers, I want to order plain iced tea, they say I can't because the sugar has already been mixed into the tea. Finally ordered iced sweet tea. Er, the iced tea arrived and at the bottom of the glass there was sugar that had not been stirred. Yes, sis, that means I can order plain without sugar üòå. You can serve it in a friendly way too, sis.

Angkringan which is always crowded with young people hanging out..

As for location: pretty good, according to the theme, which is a place to hang out üòÜüòÜ some are sitting on the floor and some are sitting at table chairs. Yesterday when I was here it suddenly rained, soo a bit wet because the sandals also dripped water from the roof. Supported by ambyar songs, it's getting better.

For food: it's delicious. It's just that yesterday when I ordered, it wasn't very dry. So there's no ""burnt"" appearance, the impression is that it's just warmed up for a while and also if you don't ask for seasoning, don't add more seasoning.. Finally I asked the waitress to burn it until it was a little burnt. Plus asking for spices.. So that the food tastes better..

The best food here is SATE SKIN which is really the winner hehehee..

Continue to be successful.

It's been a long wait, I've been waiting for 1 hour, the order hasn't arrived yet, from 21:26 to 22:34, until we finally come to the place of order, and it turns out that the order has not yet been processed, it is still in the bottom pile before being processed, finally waiting 15 more minutes for orders to be taken wrapped, taken home, no longer eaten on the spot.
For the food that is being sold, please check, because the Fish Oskab Etas I ordered, it tasted sour/stale.
BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY 1 HOUR 15 MINUTES WAITING.
ENOUGH ONCE THERE AND NOT WORTH TO TRY AGAIN.

food and drink took long to come. he said the note was lost even though the food hasn't been delivered how come it can get lost. when people who just came come first while those who have been coming since earlier haven't come for almost an hour and haven't come. when the cashier was asked the answer was not clear bitchy and when spoken to he did not respond properly. please repair the service again.

This is perfect for those who like to hang out while eating. It tastes delicious and the price is pocket friendly. It's just better to bring wet wipes because at this food court location it's rather difficult to get water. But a spoon is provided for eating.

So this outlet has a unique and cool model in my opinion, it's more like a Korean theme ""alay like that, the seats use private material and the original is nice to look at but this material if it gets hit by rain it will rot and break
This outlet is staffed by mothers and children, the mother may be in charge of taking care of food such as donuts, waffles etc. while the cute and virgin part of the barista-style drinks, it's a shame the two of them don't wear cool uniforms like outlets"" the other one instead wears short shorts. wkwkwk üòÇ...(tomorrow just wear lingerie so it's badaasss), but they still feel clumsy in the halter eh not flexible when making the order process, the plus point is that the mother-child duo are friendly üôè, one more this outlet is more for take away as a table There are no chairs, there are only chairs for waiting for the order, only 2 birds

Food review: the drinks are manstab abiz semanstab the video is cut tari vs ariel noah... oops üôä, the process of making waffles and donuts takes quite a long time even though I saw them using modern equipment (I can imagine if you get a lot of orders it will definitely be more complicated and the process will be more delayed takes a long time...

That's all... warm greetings from Garangan Elegant

The coffee taste is strong, the quality is also the best. There are donuts & cirengnya also delicious. Keep up the quality & qualityüëåüèª

The first impression begins with the conversation from the host, who happens to be the processor, who explains smoothly and never gets tired of inviting his visitors to visualize a little how coffee from Kawi is processed and served with a quite unique taste!

Apart from serving good coffee according to personal opinion, the hospitality and serenity at this place have become one of the ""escape"" and ""hidden gems"" among shops in Rajekwesi, Wilis, Malang City.

Come here every morning at 7 on Sunday-Tuesday for ""NgoPag"" and have a light discussion about the coffee served

Starting from the Manual Brew menu to the Espresso Based menu, it also has its own experience and enjoyment

With the experience and taste tours gained, Coffeenensis is counted as one of the pocket-friendly Coffee Shops, of course in accordance with Malang City which is filled with students and their walletsüòÑ

Besides being able to enjoy various coffee dishes, here you can also get Roasted Beans from Gunung Kawi which of course have been carefully curated by the Coffeenensis team.

Greetings and Success
Jaya Always for Coffeenensis & their Society!
Graceüôè

It's a comfortable place for morning coffee and hanging out until late at night, the opening hours are also regular, you can check on their ig at @coffeenensis so you know about the opening hours and the various line ups of beans.
People really like to chat and share about whatever they can, so it's also suitable to ask them questions about coffee while looking for new experiences.

I don't know why if I look on Maps it closes at 23:00. But, me and my friends want to try new vibes. Eh, it turns out that at 8 it's already closed + I ordered it just arrived 10 minutes... For the coffee, it doesn't offer anything different from other coffee shops. Be better.."

The atmosphere is really good.. it is recommended to wear a jacket upstairs the air is free so it feels cold..
The food and drinks are delicious, all of them are good... don't be disappointed

Not enough to make you feel at home.. uno blocks / uno cards

Wafa Coffee n' Space, the place is cute, clean with white and white nuances. Apart from looking cute and clean with the white tones on the building, Wafa for some reason, in my view, is just as homey as it is on the 1st floor. That doesn't mean the 2nd floor isn't comfortable. Judging from the arrangement of furniture and decorative ornaments, Wafa seems to have been designed for those of you who want to get together while being productive, but also comfortable for those of you who like to drink coffee alone, really comfortable.

Talking about the menu, you will find a lot of mixed drink menus, both cold milk coffee variants and non-coffee variants created by Wafa. Don't forget, there are also heavy meals and snacks, you know. For heavy meals, there are rice bowls with several flavors, which, to be honest, tastes good to me, pol mesio. I haven't tried it in a long time, and for snacks, you can guess for yourself.
For the price, Wafa prices its drinks and food at around 15 thousand to 25 thousand, if I'm not mistaken.

The service is good, it's just that Wafa currently seems to be hampered by the number of human resources, so sometimes you have to wait a little longer for your order to arrive.
But apparently that's a plus point, you know. So you can chat first with your friends or something like that.

Actually Wafa has a really nice atmosphere. It's good for being alone, it's good for being together, but it's a shame that Wafa's location is on the side of a road which is quite busy with driving activity so it's sometimes a bit noisy.
But it's okay, it's called the way of many people.

That's about it, the rest you can stop by directly at Wafa. I hope you all agree with the place, menu, and service provided by Wafa. Xalaam!!

Uwuuw for coffee... The price is right, the taste is delicious, it's great...

It can be an alternative for those who want to drink coffee in this area, because the drinks are delicious but the location is a bit narrow compared to other places around. It's still okay to try"

The first time to Kopi Titik Koma in Tidar. The atmosphere is really good for coffee or working alone and makes you feel at home. Moreover, the staff is also friendly and super help full.

There is a prayer room and the toilets are also clean, so for those who want WFC here it's really good. It's a shame that the toilet is a bit problematic because the spray section for wiping water only comes out a little. Hopefully it can be fixed asap.

Cozy enough for wfc alone or with friends. Each table does have a plug but only 1, so if you want to use it for a crowd you have to bring your own coiled cable. Wifi is quite smooth. Semicolon standard coffee menu and prices. Worth it for occasional try"

(-) Yoghut frp is too expensive and doesn't match the picture/menu (no real fruit, use a plastic cup), the meat and cheese pasta bolognese is a little thick and too much oil.

It is better if the menu is adjusted to the food served / food served according to the picture on the menu, so that it doesn't seem that the picture is just a sweetener and doesn't match reality.

Located near the entrance to the western part of Kepatihan.

The menu is also quite complete with competitive prices. I like the fresh vegetables which consist of boiled cassava leaves and kenikir leaves, pieces of cabbage, cucumber with sweet but spicy chili sauce.

Coffeshop which is often crowded because it's in the middle of the city right on an iconic street, especially on Saturday nights it's like an ant house üò≠.
Experience Details
‚òï : Ice Coquette and Ice Coffee Main ‚ù§
üí∏ : Almost 50k ü§ë
‚è≥ : 15 min order time üëå
üìç : Other Heart Coffee, Jalan Tunjungan branch
üóì : April 2022 (Ramadan)

Krn is one of the tourist attractions so it is very crowded, especially at night. So don't be surprised if your order takes a little longer than average. Cleanliness is maintained and the room is relatively narrow. The concept of the place is like a food court where there are lots of millennial food and drinks in it. So you won't run out of options. The building consists of 2 floors and there are indoor and outdoor rooms available. The indoor room is very crowded usually for waiting for orders.
However, my advice is that it's better to take a walk along Tunjungan Street with your partner, family, children, where there are lots of vintage photo spots.
Along the way there are many freelance photographers. Every photographer has a different fee, so it's better to ask first.

I ordered a coffee variant, Es Kopi Main ‚ù§ which has elements of espresso, milk and palm sugar. Meanwhile, my wife ordered non-coffee, namely Es Centil which has elements of yakult, lychee n mint. I'm not a coffee expert so I think the taste is the same as palm sugar coffee in general. Nothing special. What's special is that the ice is a little but the palm sugar coffee is full ü§≠.
For Es Centil, I feel the yakult is more dominant...and if you want something fresh or fresh, Es Centil can be an option ü•∂.

For the price, yes, the modern Millennial CoffeeShop standard in general, starting from 20k, regardless of the espresso menu.

So, if you want to find Malioboro vibes or a busy night with lots of food and drinks, there's nothing wrong with stopping by Kopi Lain Hati Tunjungan whose quality and credibility has been maintained üòâ.

Every time you go to the new Tunjungan road, you have to stop by here. It turns out that the place is very comfortable above when the night is breezy. If the coffee is different, it's already a mainstay
the miss & the romance.

One of the recommended coffee places in Surabaya. The location is on Jalan Tunjungan. There is an indoor area below and an outdoor area above. The outdoor place is suitable for photos because it directly faces Tunjungan street. For the taste and price, the coffee is standard cafe. There is a car park on the side of the Tunjungan road, specifically at 16.00-19.00 it is not allowed to park on the side of the Tunjungan road.

This place is on the edge of Jalan Tunjungan, right in the Trafficbun, so 1 is the place. The place is okay, the service is friendly, I came here when it was quiet, so yeah, the service is okay. I ordered iced capers if I'm not mistaken. Yes, the taste is pretty good, the chocolate flavor hehehe. The drink is a bit runny, so it's not too thick (the chocolate flavor isn't thick). But because the place is narrow and only a few seats are used, it's definitely a hassle when it's crowded. Hopefully in the future it can be improved even more, thank you üôèüèª

There are quite a lot of menu variants. There are 3 menu categories, namely hot coffee menu, iced without coffee, and iced coffee. The price is standard, like coffee in general. The coffee is fresh, not bad. One of the good coffee places and recommendations for enjoying coffee. The location is close to Traffic Bun. Good service."

Just put an event to create a crowd

Yuhuuu buy 1 get 1 free..!

It's still in the Kayutangan Heritage section, although it's a bit out of the way. But it's better here, the ambiance is nice and not too crowded. In the center of Kayutangan Heritage, you can't expect it because it's crowded with people, I can't enjoy it if I am (the part of the street with lots of lights)

The place is spacious and clean, food and drinks are affordable too. Prices listed include tax. Friendly and prompt service. Try the Teh Tarik, it's really fresh and not too sweet. The toast is small in portion but delicious too. Top really. There are selling heavy food, Nasi Jeruk but I didn't try it.

Hopefully it can be crowded as well as other cafes in the center of Kayutangan Heritage.

Kopte merupakan cafe baru yg terletak di sepanjang Kayutangan Heritage. Letaknya yg strategis mnjadi kelebihan cafe ini. Tempat parkir cukup luas soalnya sudah ada tukang parkir nya. Suasana cukup nyaman meskipun agak panas karena tidak ada AC. Pelayanannya ramah dan cepat. Harga tergolong murah karena berkisar antara 13k keatas. Menu andalan tentu saja kopi tarik dan teh tarik yang rasanya khas karena dibuat langsung fresh. Juga bisa lihat proses pembuatannya secara langsung. Overall recomended buat yg mau ngopi murah di sekitar Kayutangan.

‚Ä¢ Sorry I didn't take a photo of the drink, because it's really basic, really plain glasses don't have letterhead like the one on the branding
‚Ä¢ As for the taste, it's really delicious, a type of tea that's bitter and not too sweet, the process of making it is really pulled between one cup and another
‚Ä¢ the cup size is also regular, so for those who like to be thirsty or usually with large portions, it's not recommended, there's no large size
‚Ä¢ I suggest that please give the characteristics of screen printing on the plastic cup, because if it's plain, it doesn't make any difference from tea, it's 5,000 on the side of the road, especially at a price of 15,000 and above"

Really like the coffee vibes at Kayu Tangan. Especially in Wan Chai, the place is clean, comfortable, and also authentic like coffee with the theme of Chinese vibes in general.

For snacks I bought fried gyoza and spring rolls, for the fillings the meat really tastes good, even the fiber is still visible when bitten, the skin is also crunchy and crunchy. good job!

Try Wan Chai Kopitiam in the Kayutangan shopping district of Malang. The main food is hainan rice & dimsum. The drinks are great. the hainan rice uses grilled chicken, tastes good but the portion is not big enough. I don't like the dimsum because there are lots of young bones.

Good Food
Good drink
Good Price

From the outside it looks like an ordinary small cafe, but it turns out to be a very proper restaurant. The interior is super nice and well laid out, clean and tidy, the green tones are really pretty.

The service is very good, you don't have to wait too long for the food & drinks to come out. The ambiance is really nice and makes you feel at home for long. The music played is mostly jazz, perfect for casual conversation.

For food and drinks tend to be pricey. It looks okay, but the taste is really ordinary for that price. The hazelnut milkshake has lots of ice cubes, then the cream itself is half a glass. As far as I know, a milkshake should have milk and ice cream blended together, not hazelnut milk, add ice cubes and then add whipped cream to half a cup. The straws use paper straws, it's good to care for the environment but it makes it hard to drink the cream.

If the latte is okay, served with cookies and sugar separately. It feels great.

Cozy Hangout Place at Sukun

KADO Cafe offers a warm ambience, as well as friendly service. The place is quite spacious and there are also indoor and outdoor areas. Wifi is fast and there are plugs available, perfect for hanging out or working on assignments. I came here when it was just 2 months old. The menu offered is quite diverse, but not too much. It took quite a long time for the food to arrive, around 35 minutes, even though we were the only family dining in. Standard price 20k-50k. For the taste of the food it's not bad, Woku Chicken can be more absorbed in the seasoning, Cordon Bleu can have more portions. Sambal matah tastes fresh. Club Sandwich is on point. Overall there is still a lot that can be improved in terms of taste for KADO Eatery. Always success!

Food and drinks are good and quite a variety. Affordable prices

Run by a couple, Virginia and Evan, their cheerful personality can be a great company while you enjoy your drink of choice. These two are excellent sparing partner in cards playing so if you want to test your strategy while sipping on your delicious coffee, ask them to play cards with you. They also provide delicious choices of quick-grab food for your lunch or dinner whenever you feel like you want something to eat but not too heavy to match with your coffee. A group of four would be a great choice to visit while more than that can be quite overcrowded. There are selection of manga books you can choose to read and you can request a song or two to enjoy. One minor setback, the parking spot is limited so car-driving visitors may find it a little challenging to find a spot to park. Best if you are driving a motorcycle or bicycle. Check out this place to enjoy new coffee drinking experience.

Edit per July 3rd, 2022:
There's a new coffee drink they added called Mario's Specialty. Why the name? Go and find it out by yourself, there's a story behind it. It tastes quite easy on the tongue with all the goodness of what the coffee beans may offer plus the richness of milk and some other secret ingredients only they - Virginia and Evan, the owner - know. You can customized the level of sweetness (standard/half/quarter) to suit your own taste. Check out the last photo I added for a quick sample of the drink. My grade for this one? 9 out of 10. Love it. It is my new standard drink whenever I visit the place. You should check it out too. I'm sure you won't disappointed on this one. Happy trying and let me know your thought on it.

Small coffee shop in a neighborhood. The coffee is quite nice and the service is very good on my two visits. The price is excellent. There is only outdoor seating for about 6 people total. Staying in this neighborhood, it‚Äôs perfect to just swing by and grab a quick coffee!!!

Great place to find a flavor, coffee and japanese dishes they have. Great!

Nice coffee

Before coming here, I often ordered food and drinks from this cafe via the Gojek application. Out of curiosity about the place, I finally took the time to come to enjoy it in person. And I don't regret it!

This cafe has a relatively small place. There are two tables with several benches. So my advice, if you want to come in a group, no more than 4 people. Even though it's small, my experience here is still fun and filling!

The food and drink menu available here is quite affordable with great taste! Because I've ordered via the Gojek application, so I'm familiar with the menus. One of the recommended and favorite menus here is Butter Rice Chicken Katsu. And it's just *chef's kiss*. The portion is enough to fill a hungry student's stomach after doing the assignment.

The owner and Ocil the black and white cat who likes to stop by here are very friendly. Ocil seems too friendly, just met him and fell asleep on my lap üòÇ But that made my experience even more memorable!

For those who want to chat casually with friends while drinking fresh coffee and eating heavy or light, this place is perfect for you! I'll definitely come back here!"

Really disappointed with the Kopken branch here, my heart's intention was to find safe coffee right in Malang, because I've always been happy with Kopken from the past, until this branch the unfriendly staff seemed to be rushing customers who wanted to choose the menu even though no one was queuing after me. Please go into more detail about the branch issues here, from the rating that I see, the average is aimed at employees who lack experience, seem unfriendly and perform ineffectively or waste a lot of time. Enough of my disappointment. Hopefully there is an improvement.

A place to hang out right in front of the Lucky Suropati stadium. Here provides snacks and drinks. On this occasion I had the chance to try the cappuccino and cireng milkshake. The drinks and snacks here are pretty good, but the milkshakes are a little too sweet. The cireng is delicious, even though it's cold it's still delicious and not mushy. The price is quite relevant to the given place. Overall 7/10 for the location, mamin and vibe.

A very strategic location on Jl Pahlawan Kota Pasuruan in front of UNTUNG SUROPATI STADIUM. Line up with Nelongso fried chicken outlets, order coffee, ice baskets. For those who miss the atmosphere of Jogja, it's very appropriate to chill, hanging out here. The menu is a typical Javanese menu of very varied food and drinks at friendly prices. Keep obeying the health protocol, ok? Hand washing is also provided here at several points. Enjoy and Let's Talk.

A comfortable coffee shop with high speed wifi, located across from the main gate of Untung Suropati Stadium

ADVICE FOR OWNER!!!
the place is quite good and comfortable, but criticism is for the waiter so as not to shout the name of the buyer.
Can each table use a number as well as anticipate the splash of saliva on the food that is not closed when the waiter shouts the name of the buyer to find a place to sit....,
while maintaining PRIVACY and politeness to visitors so that their names are not broadcast in the crowd of other visitors."

Lumintu Sticky Rice. Hearing the name of the unit, you can imagine how it tastes and what food and drink menus are served by this restaurant. Yes, tonight, at 21:20, I just arrived, according to the serlok, the location of the goggle map sent by my business partner, namely the director of the Mushroom Construction Group, whose house is only 20 meters from this restaurant. The location is on the right of the road if we go from the direction of Dieng Plaza to the south after meeting the red light at the intersection, then turn right for about 20 meters, cus. Arrived at the eastern sticky rice restaurant. Immediately, my colleagues were told to order. Lightning fast, tell the cashier, order the original sticky rice (ketan dkw) the price on the written prize list board. Keep drinking hot tea. My colleague drank hot ginger, special sticky rice powder. And for parking if r4 is limited, yes. If R 2, accommodate, yes 15 motorcycles. The total bill was about 20 thousand. Sbw, 0812+4212014

Help the male employees who wear glasses be more educated about ethics. I didn't talk to him, instead I joined in with the old way.

This is the first time a coffee employee has memories like this. Usually it's just fine, friendly and enjoy... uh this is a guy but his mouth is like a girl's just scowling when someone is talking.

If you still maintain employees like that... I can report to the CONSUMER PROTECTION FOUNDATION for the unpleasant behavior of the employees.

I hope that the big name KOPI KENANGAN is supported by employees who have good ethics.

Thanks

Here the coffee tastes different from other memorable coffees, the body is too bold, too strong, seems to use a different blend of coffee, like using robusta coffee, or maybe it was just a one time accident when I ordered it in the morning via ojol.

Try it for the first time and order via grabfood. This time, the order is iced coffee from memories of the former + iced chocolate runaway. The iced coffee from this former memory tastes okay for me, who doesn't really like coffee, taste 8/10. But for the big no ice chocolate, the taste is far from expectations. Compared to pure cocoa, it has ch*time so much taste. Taste 7/10.

The coffee is pretty good... The price is also comfortable in the 18k pocket for a latte

For toppings, you can ask for more.. toppings with bubbles, Oreos and a few others... Usually around 6k per topping."

If you come here, just park on the side of the road so you don't pay for parking

This milk is really recommended compared to the copy next to it. The seller said that the milk used was genuine cow's milk, not sasetan milk in general. Behind the copy, you are treated to a very beautiful panorama, the lights of the house that look like stars. Invite your girlfriend to have coffee here, guarantee it's beautiful and hopefully get to the aisle okay

the noodles are cheap 10 thousand jumbo portions already vegetables and crackers
The corn is standard but it doesn't taste good
good place to eat
the view can be because the view of the stone city at night
the drinks are also cheap, not expensive
so it's better to buy noodles and drink sachets and it's full while looking at the view of the stone city

The coffee is ok. There is no place to eat/drink on the spot. There is one on the side with a roof, but when I went there during the day it was really dark. The chairs in front of the shop were also compacted, maybe because of covid.

At that time the breads were no longer in the display area, so all that was left was the drinks. The delicious milk coffee with rum (forgot the name). Coldbrew Robusta is pretty good too.

What's worse is that the shopkeeper doesn't wear a mask..... even when making and serving drinks. So it's a bit ilfeel. Even though I'm not afraid of Covid, that's not the case either. There still has to be a health protocol. For shop owners please tighten again.

For taste, this one menu is pretty good and the texture of the snail is soft. For flavors, there are several variants, including sweet spicy, spicy, and very spicy.

I had the experience of buying 2 portions of snails for 50 thousand, he said, 2 portions of half a kilo, it turns out, even a quarter of a kilo didn't arrive, and again it was delivered by courier, we were told to pay for the postage without prior approval... very disappointing, it didn't match the advertisement ,,üëé

Amazing

This place actually exceeded my expectation‚ú® At first I thought it was a coffee shop that only relied on the coffee, but it turns out the food is heavy too! I ordered fried noodles, and it tastes so GOOD!

For a more comfortable atmosphere, choose the inside. The atmosphere is shady and calm, like a joglo house.

For those of you who don't like cats, this might be a problem because there are some cats hanging around the shop. But they're cute, don't worry! Give some food and go.

The drawback is that the service is a bit slow. So, just be patient, it's worth the time‚ú®

Good taste of coffe

Try it,

menu coffee : bon bon.
Palm sugar milk coffee, very sweet, the coffee has less taste, the milk is stronger.

Menu non-coffee : matcha
It's sweet too, the taste of the matcha is so soft..

There is a place outside the stand, about 5 tables.

Is this the different Bon-bon concoctions for each branch? In this branch, the palm sugar is really economical. Almost didn't taste the palm sugar. Meanwhile, in Klampis, you can just taste the palm sugar

Good and friendly service, and helpful in providing explanations about drinks. The place is small and there is only 1 table but for me the taste of tea is delicious, not too sweet and still tastes like tea. Recommended to try for those who like tea."

Now try it, because I've never tried it before. why order this one because the color is unique hehe. Honestly, I don't know what Folks Blue is, but when you drink it, it tastes taro, vanilla and a little blueberry all together. For the cheese itself, I think it's inferior to the Folks Blue because it's really sweet, the boba is smaller than what I usually order elsewhere. but it's still delicious when bitten like that hehe. Even though I think it's really sweet, it's still delicious to drink

Is one of the Cheese Tea booths which is quite popular in Malang City. There are various cheese tea drink menus available, and the prices are quite affordable. For purchases, you can take in or through the ojol application. because it is only in the form of a booth / stall, the place to stop is very limited, and the parking space follows the existing stall. There are no toilets or prayer rooms available. Even so, now Cheese Tea is quite popular with young people.

Just a suggestion, maybe the cooking can be accelerated. Because I often get orders here, the cooking takes a long time. And for drinks, it's better to use a sealer, even if you don't have a sealer, it's better to just wrap it in plastic.

Although I bought it when they had promo. 50.000 for one small cup. But I expected the taste from the yogurt was exactly like a yogurt and It taste just so so. But it's nice though to mix your own flavors and toppings freely.

Just try their beverages.

Delicious, take it yourself, choose your own taste, 1 cup regular 50,000 during the promo, I like the white original plain tamarind flavor the best, only the toppings for those in the package cannot have fruit toppings, those that are allowed non-fruit toppings. Finished select will be weighed.

My husband and children really enjoy coming here. There are often promos, take as much as you like in 1 cup (can be up to mount) for only 50k. The chocolate and cheesecake flavors are really like ice cream, you don't feel like eating frozen yogurt. Perfect for those who don't like acid. But if you want the yogurt taste, you can try the plain tart. It's sour, and not too sweet either.

The only minus is that the place is small, only fits 4 people inside. While this pandemic is impossible to eat on the go.

The spoon is good too. Usually I take it home and then I drink honey. Until there are many at home"

The coffee is delicious, there is a 30% discount using shopee pay.
If you like coffee with the smell of rum, there is Irish coffee. Cappuccino, machiato, milk coffee are also available. There are quite a lot of variants.

As for the packaging, it's standard millennial drinks, right?
As for the taste, it's quite brown, it's just that when it arrives here it doesn't kick enough, I assume it's because of the ice cubes that melted along the way my friend came to my place üòÖ. maybe if you drink it right there it will definitely get wet...

I really like it because the bobba is fresh, aka cooked before serving. So when you chew it feels chewy

The taste is pretty good, not bad, it's a type of brown sugar boba which isn't thick so it doesn't taste sour, the boba is quite chewy, at a standard price, it's similar to other modern brown sugar milk boba. If you say it's special, it's not, but if you want brown sugar boba milk it's still quite satisfying. The packaging is pretty good too. Overall, the brown sugar milk is standard and doesn't disappoint.

The waiters are kind. It's a shame that the mall and the market are still very quiet, because of the pandemic. easy and fast.

Just a suggestion for those who want to buy xiboba here, if it's just opened, don't buy it right away. Yesterday I bought boba, the boba wasn't fully ripe, maybe because it was just opened."

The atmosphere was inviting and cozy, making it a great spot to relax with a cup of coffee. However, I was disappointed to find that many items on their menu were unavailable, despite the shop being new. Additionally, the taste of the coffee and food items I tried was just okay, not standing out in any way. I hope to see a wider selection of food and drinks in the future. The 2nd floor doesn‚Äôt have any tables or chairs

Very friendly service. Food hygiene is also maintained, as evidenced by the spoons wrapped in plastic for each food ordered. There is free WiFi too.

The food is delicious and definitely halal. The price is also in accordance with the taste offered. There's even a promo so it's cheaper. Super like the drink :)

For a comfortable atmosphere, you can choose to sit in a chair (1st floor) or cross-legged (2nd floor). Only when I went to the 1st floor, the table was a bit wobbly, so it wasn't comfortable. Maybe it can be fixed...

The first time I came here, the impression was that the design was unique, good. The first husband chose Balinese coffee and Toraja but it was empty. Finally choose Lampung coffee. But, the taste is not bad. The service is really top. All friendly service. Get free french fries. thank you

The orange juice here has special oranges, because it's been said, it's been filtered but the seeds are still in, blended again, it tastes extraordinarily bitter, it's my turn to complain, instead of admitting that it's not filtered, it's not even filtered, but the seeds are in, HELLOOOWW HOW MUCH ORANGE SEEDS, HOW MUCH FILTER BAMBANG.... the owner of the brand decided to replace it, but this counter is still looking for reasons, the point is that I don't want to be wrong, but it's okay, SINCERELY IS MONEY, 2 GLASSES OF ORANGE JUICE, CUS...

Not have experienced

Unpleasant incident buying LPG for the first and last time here, never again. I asked the shop keeper to deliver and install the LPG, the person said yes and I paid 18 thousand. Then I said that the stove is on the 2nd floor. Ok. Then it turned out that he couldn't put the new one on and the tube was dripping, and it was really rusty and it was so bad that I was scared. The reason is that the diameter of the lpg holes is not the same, I have to replace the regulator even though it's new. The one who is at home is his wife. I was even told to be honest right when I was in the shop if I was told to put it on and on the 2nd floor. Eh, sir, where if people can do something, there's not much of an excuse, right? Eh, when he finally gave up, he didn't install it, instead he wanted to go home. I didn't say just bring the new LPG because I was afraid it would leak, I had good intentions to just change the shipping fee because it was really close to the boarding house. And my LPG cylinder was still new and actually the regulator still showed that there was content, it just glowed red. The guy chuckled, didn't want to return the money, instead he said yes, I already have enough money, 18,000 I can't get anything. I said, please, if I lose, I won't get anything, instead the hose and stove are removed. Yes, it's better not to be there, it's still on. The point is I'm disappointed, if I say I'm told to be sincere, that's fine, but the way of selling like that isn't a blessing, sir. Not recommended at all. Such shame to ever purchase from this shop

There is a new coffee shop, located inside UB, just outside the UB central library. The shop is really small, you can sit in the aisles/chairs outside the library, which are usually used by students to hang out or do assignments.

The menu is quite diverse, the price may be relatively a little expensive, but the taste is quite good, so it's not bad. Service okay and fast.

Not only coffee, tea too. I am very happy to be able to work with coffee alumni. Recommended for enjoying the vibes of the UB library.

The place is small but comfortable especially for waiting in line, or flash bites between patient shifts.

The decoration of the room is cool, utilizing the corner space on the 2nd floor. The furniture is also a combination of classic and modern which really blends together.

But what's a bit annoying is actually the barista might be even cooler if you use a barista apron with the cafe branding. Because several times the barista came here wearing the UMM Hospital employee uniform batik. So it kind of loses the feel of the cafe a bit üòÖ

For the menu, I like caramel macchiato the most. The sweetness is just right, a little sweet, but still safe, not as sweet as in cafes in general.

For those who don't know and want to know
What's an ice pot?
The ice pot is marni colored ice cream placed in a small pot which also has various colors and is decorated with toppings according to your wishes.
It can be chocolate granules, fruit, jelly, colorful candies and chocolate milk which makes the ice cream just unique
This ice cream doesn't taste much different from the ice cream we usually eat
It's just that it's made in a very unique and funny way, sometimes it's a shame to eat itüòÇ
This ice was very popular at the time, it's just normal now
In Malang, it's in the food court, Malang Town Square, or commonly called MATOS
But the 1st floor is near the stairs
More or less priced at 10-15 thousand per portion, I'm very satisfied with choosing my favorite topping. 1 topping 1 top layer yes
If it's more than that, you usually pay more

Not bad. Unfortunately, when I bought it, Ms. forgot to give the worms. Maybe because the first buyer.

It Crimea..

Btw, the cup is bigger than the usual coffee milk.

The type of side dish is usually peanuts and fried blinjo. The price of August 2020 with one egg and ginger is not spicy 18 thousand rupiah. Also sells half-boiled eggs and wedang ginger.

This is my first time buying from this store. Previously in another branch, it seemed okay. I came maybe at 21.15, I really wanted to take away I bought cans to take home. When I want to pay, wow, the reminder is very sharp. ""Can't dine in already."" , ""can't have cash to be cashless"" more or less said like this in a very curt tone. I was just very surprised, why did it have to be so snappy. If I do dine in, I'll definitely ask first if it's still possible or not. Oh, too harsh, no smile at all.

This is no longer a Vanilla Cafe & Sushi. But change to KPK Resto.
The second branch of KPK Resto but not as good as the one in Soekarno Hatta. Maybe because it's new and new staff.
Our food came but there were no spoons to eat, the first time we asked to be brought only 1 spoon, so we had to ask 2 times to bring 6 more spoons. The AC was reluctant to turn on, had to ask first (my second experience here).
But for the food, the taste is still as good as the one at Soekarno Hatta. Come out full

there is parking for motorbikes and cars. the place is big, nice, it's cold at night so it's better to prepare a jacket. can be rented for events too, can + live music too if I'm not mistaken. the place is a bit unique, the interior is eclectic, the lights are so cool, they keep coming through the shop in front of them. on some tables there are plugs, so sabi for nugas too. which in my opinion is less, maybe the main light can be added just 1 neon LED in the middle so it's not too dim

DISH
the food is delicious, the mentai sauce is real with tobiko, the blackpepper sauce is also very flavorful with the black pepper so it's not just sweet. The drink is also great, the chocolate ice is really nyoklat, not too sweet. But at night, the hot tea is the best, one pot and the black pepper rice bowl.

LIVE MUSIC
then certain days there is live music, it's really cool outdoor semi outdoor looking green while listening to music.

very good, especially the price is very cheap, drinks 10-20 thousand, snacks 12 thousand, food 20 thousand. On gofood/grabfood/shopeefood there is usually a promo too

Is it really wobbly or is the fish cracker shattered, isn't it? To answer curiosity so we decided to give it a try. The first impression is the standard cleanliness of the tent stall. Mayan prices are cheap for the size of the area where several hotels are located. Soto ordinary 10,000, rawon 15,000. And after ordering, it's recommended. The koyahnya koyah hakiki (roasted from grated coconut) so that the fresh, savory soup is even more savory. The 3,000 coffee is pretty good, thick and not too sweet. The milk coffee isn't really recommended: it's easy if the Javanese say, cuer there's no kick of coffee or milk. Maybe it's because the price is only 3000 times... My suggestion is to increase the price of milk coffee by 5000 but it tastes great, so it can give a good impression.
