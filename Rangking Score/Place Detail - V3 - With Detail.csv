Comfortable and always makes me remember my hometown, I often come here for work or just ha ha hi hi, the waiters are also friendly, oh there's something special about this caffee, the waiter always makes blank, maybe one of the characteristics of this cafe.

The place is unique.
Javanese traditional theme. Same with the name.

It's convenient to do assignments here because there are plenty of seats on the back and comfortable.
Cool place.

The price is cheap, but the taste is not suitable for me. Hehehe..

But when it comes to coffee, jos crashes here.
And also here, God willing, everyone understands coffee.
Ha ha ha..

The place is comfortable, for santuuy.
Like the original iced coffee milk, red Velvet.
Mojitonya also delicious, segeer.

The wedang jancur makes the body warm.
Fried plantains are very delicious. Curious about the recipe üòÅ

The place is nice and comfortable. Miniature Jogja in Malang . The toilet is clean. Laughing mosque.

Those who want to try coffee plus charcoal, here you can really do it. But keep in mind that here it's only cash only."

good service I like it, in terms of taste I really like it

Cheap and delicious, all affordable, on the side of a major road, the price is suitable for students. You can also hang out while watching UB's walking activities.

really good woyyy!! where is it cheap? Mom, I'm addicted to it hahaha.. If you're at home, the mainstay of the Aladin menu is boba fresh milk. Its advantages besides being cheap, if it doesn't run out, you can put it in the refrigerator again and the plus point is that even though the boba is still chewy until tomorrow! the location is in front of the UB, which is Mt Haryono, if you're coming from the McD direction, go left. you have to be slow"" look for it because it's a bit narrow. but don't worry because the color of the shop is green, so it's definitely visible.

The taste is really authentic where the prices are also friendly again. The place is relatively quiet and comfortable"

Lowokwaru, Kota Malang, Jawa Timur 65142, Indonesia","cafe, point_of_interest, store, food, establishment",4.5,1662,2,"The place is located on the 2nd floor of Sch. It has smoking and non-smoking area. It‚Äôs neat and cozy, that kind of place you could spend your time for chit-chatting or doing your work/thesis. It provides most of western foods and some of asian‚Äôs. It also serve snacks, pastries and bakeries for you to munch around. The staffs are good and helpful, the toilet is clean, and the prayer‚Äôs room is neat and clean (it provides a very fragrant prayer‚Äôs mat and prayer‚Äôs set).

My favorite beverage from this cafe is Milkshake. I didn't find a matcha milkshake for this cafe. When I was a college student, this cafe was always crowded but cozy and quiet.

I recommended Work From Cafe in this place. This cafe must maintain the furniture and interior, but for the taste always be lovely, for waitpersons must smile and be friendly to the customer. BTW, this cafe must pay attention to the plating.

Nice and cozy place and they have smoking (outdoor) and non-smoking (indoor) areas separated. Free Wi-fi and power outlets are available. I think the number of the tables is a little bit small, not surprising because the place is not big. Nevertheless, with the right and nice interiors and light, it feels spacious enough. They apply the new normal protocol so we found that some tables are not in used. I think the chair could be imrpoved, though. I certainly like it if it more comfortable, especially if I want to do my work in the place.
We tried the apple pie, which is part of the pastries displayed at the front counter. It was scrumptious, with the perfect crispy, flaky dough and the right sweetness and sourness of the apple filling. The caesar salad comes as a combination of lettuces, generous amount of grilled chicken, and a slice of garlic bread but with different dressing than the usual yellow caesar dressing I used to know. It uses some kind of mayonnaise combined with certain herbs and spices I think? Kinda tasted the parsley in the dressing somehow. It tasted nice and fresh.
The salted spicy tofu is good, although I prefer mine to be a little bit more salty. It comes with a separate sauce made of sweet soy sauce and chili flakes. The vegetables cream soup tasted good but the texture is somehow quite thick, reminds me of a very thick porridge instead of soup. They're certainly generous with the amount of the vegetables, however.
The chocolate+milk is quite nice, while the iced lemon tea is proved to be a hit for me (definitely want to order it again!). We're lucky enough to get a free ice cream waffle with minimum 100K rupiahs purchase (choose between chocolate, strawberry, or banana one). The strawberry waffle comes with strawberry ice cream, strawberry slices, strawberry jam, and whipped cream that I found very rare used in the waffle sold here in the city. The offer will last until the end of August, by the way.

This place is cozy and classy. You can see yellowish color across the room, so it makes you hungry as soon as you enter the room and almost don't wanna leave it :)) but, if you want to sit comfortably, you may come at afternoon or evening here since this place is too crowded at night. Don't worry about the food and beverages quality, 5 stars are for all menu. Standing applause!

Matcha, Big French Stick, Caramel Macchiato. Cozy and unforgettable place."

LOVE PLACE BEST VIEWS

After not being here for a long time, I was surprised, it turned out that the cafe had been renovated in such a way. In the past this cafe was very simple with a sky roof and vines, now this cafe has turned into an aesthetic cafe with various ornaments. In the past, the outlets were only available at certain points, now the outlets are made evenly spread in almost every corner. The place is getting nicer and more comfortable, then the price is also still in the pocket of students. For the menu, then and now there have been many changes, even almost all of the menus are new menus. In the past, the heavy food menu was only indomie rice noodles, now the heavy food menu is quite varied and suitable to fill the stomach while enjoying the breeze in the afternoon. What I really miss about this place are the cute cats. There used to be a jet black village cat whose voice was very cute and made me miss. Yesterday when I visited again unfortunately did not meet the black cat. Really recommended this place

The place is comfortable. It is recommended to come here at night with friends. The most delicious place lesehannya. In addition to the availability of wifi, there is also a wall socket for those who want to charge their cellphones or laptops at the sitting area. You can read contemporary books at the cross-legged area and you can borrow a guitar or a card from the receptionist/cashier to play with friends."

As a non coffee lover. The butter coffee is not bitter and tasted good. The fried noodle is decent. A bit too sweet for my preferences. Crowded and smoking area but overall good

Best kopitiam in malang town so far
I have tried some kind of places in malang, and i found that this place is the best overall
I like the butter coffee, not to sweet not to strong
I like the kaya butter toast too. It is a perfect combination.
I ordered the other food too, and all was good. The price is really affordable.
But, there is not enough chair and table. You have to queue for about 10-20 minutes. N.b i came at 10 am
Definitely will come back next time

oldschool kopitiam that everyone would love! it's located near train station, so we made a short visit to takeaway some food to be enjoyed in train. overall it tasted good with affordable price

If you like retro places, you must try this coffee shop. The vibes of this place is like 80s Singaporean coffee shops, who served Coffee, Milk Tea, Bread, and Half-boiled Egg. The coffees are great, their must try are the Butter Coffee and Coffee with Evaporated Milk. But if you like the classic, their Classic Black Coffee is a bomb. Also the Kaya Butter Bread! Sweetness from the Kaya jam and the saltiness of the butter mixed very well, it's delicious! Their menu is not too much, just a bit snacks like Cireng, Mendoan and Ngo Hiong (this one, very recommended!!), also the main course, like Fried Bakmee (a bit too sweet for me, but still delish!) and Soup Bakmee. Also the ambience, it's very cozy and calm, you'll want to spend hours here if you love the old city vibes. Definitely gonna come back if I visit Malang again!"

I ordered mie goreng and tea., the tea taste really good. Mie goreng was abit salty., next time should try the coffee. I went there before christmas, they put nice christmas ornaments

The atmosphere there is good.
But the food there is not really satisfying. Honey chicken was either over-fried or fried again and the taste is very ordinary. Not going to pay a cafe price for that kind of food quality.
There heritage noodles also taste just like mie goreng from any other street food stores. Sorry to say, taste and potion are better in those food stores.
So, not very recommend to eat there.
However, the coffee is ok.

If you're a morning person, this place may suit your appetite looking for new ideas. It has an Instagrammable view at every corner. There are variety of coffee and food menu when you're looking forward of a big breakfast. The price is in middle range. It's not too expensive nor too cheap as well. But, the taste of the food is so so for me. The service is okay despite I've had uncomfortable event when the waiter was reluctantly serving us breakfast. Maybe I should come another day to
experience a different service."

Java Dancer located in a quiet residential area. It is small enough to seat about 15 people, and the interior is as cute as its pretty name. Even though it is early for dinner, there are 7-8 locals seated. Ordered a salad and chicken for coffee and a light meal. Quantity is more than expected. Delicious coffee and food. But Salad is so salty.

After a hot day wandering lost and stressed around Malang, this was such a relaxing place to cool off. We felt so happy and relaxed in this beautiful shop, surrounded by plants and the sound of bubbling water.

They have single origin coffees from around Indonesia, which can be brewed in five different ways. This was fun to tour. We tried the Kintamani brewed in a siphon, which was mild, with a mango juice they prepared with 100% mango and cream. So refreshing! It's a little expensive as they have some extra charges for certain taxes, which was explained in the menu. Just don't be surprised by the bill.

The ambiance is the strongest point, along with a great menu of drinks and food.

Cosy open air caf√© with extensive menu for both international and local food! We came here for the espressos and they really hit the spot! We indulged on an affogato and ginger latte as well as some delicious pancakes and roti bantal with chocolate!

Wonderful decor and experience for a foreigner like me to see the batik, masks and other traditional puppets. We went between meals but The food looked amazing and I would love to go back and try it.

Got there for just take some coffee..
Ordered hot cappuccino with extra shoot..They used their specialty house blend coffee..

Love the atmosphere and the food.
It is worth the price. And it is quite cheap compare to other cafes in Malang.

However, it took soooo much time for the food to be ready. Maybe because it's always crowded with people.
Also, they played the music so loud. So you might reconsider to visit this place if you like a quiet place. But they also provide a special room for study or work, so you might use that.

Don't ride a car to visit this place, it's hard to find the parking lot.

Semusim Cafe is on St. MT. Haryono Malang, exactly across from Brawijaya University. This cafe has two floors which are always busy every day with visitors who are mostly students. This cafe sells cheap food and drinks so it is suitable for student pockets, prices start from 7,000 to 20,000. This cafe is open every day, open from 10.00 to 00.00. This cafe has a Scandinavian decoration concept so it is very interesting to visit. and apart from that this cafe also has air-conditioned first floor facilities, there are sockets on each table without worrying about running out of battery, as well as a prayer room for Muslim visitors. Meanwhile, the second floor is a smoking zone as well as a place to carry out tasks. This floor cafe is non-AC, it won't feel hot because of the lots of ventilation and the use of fans to provide extra comfort to visitors.

Price is so affordable. Taste is okay not so extraordinary, only got the problem with too much sweetness for the drink. Place is well and nice, so comfy and having a decent interior.

Hands down one of the most comfortable coffeeshops in Malang. Even though the location is not too close to the Soehat area, it turns out that the trip there is worth it.

First, you see the building looks like a vintage house, but overall it looks neat, the combination with the furniture which is dominated by wood, fits perfectly. It feels cool and homey, especially the area isn't too crowded, so you can feel calm.

Try ordering the Japanese brew and heavy food. Make the coffee just right and make it proper, following the barista's advice for the choice of beans, and it turns out to be exactly according to taste. There are many drink menu choices, whether you want coffee or non-coffee.

For food, you can order curry rice, this one is special. I myself don't often order heavy food at coffeeshops in Malang, but here it really is, the food is delicious. The curry is really good, even though it's not too thick but the taste itself is delicious. Plus there is katsu which is big in size and rice which seems to be in the panfry again so it has a taste. The food combination is really delicious, guaranteed not to regret it. And the portions are huge for the price. For now it's a favorite curry in Malang, you can even find something unique in a coffee shop. There are also several kinds of heavy food and all of them are interesting, of course I will try the others on my next visit.

The service is also very friendly and quite good, can also provide an explanation regarding the food and drinks that we will order, where a brief description is also given on the menu.

The seating area consists of indoor, semi-outdoor and outdoor. I myself sat in the semi-outdoor patio area near the bar. There are also plugs available so that it is suitable for working while drinking coffee and eating. The smoking area is in the outdoor near the parking lot. The seats themselves aren't that many, but considering the proportions to the build, they're just right.

Additional facilities such as wifi are also available, there are also toilets.

Parking for cars is in front of the coffeeshop while motorbikes are in the side area, enough to accommodate visitors.

Overall, it's really nice to have coffee in a quite different area, a quiet area. Suitable for work while enjoying coffee. Plus, the food is delicious, this is really a plus, so you don't have to bother moving places to eat. Make sure to include the list of coffeeshops that you will visit!"

The place vibe is so lit. With the wide sky view, and the green scenery add the comforting atmosphere when you're in here. The waffles are truly worth a try. It's only have a few selection of beverages and food, but the choices are nice. Really recommend for those who want to have a nice silent background.

Good place for enjoying aeropress coffee

a good place and good food. the price starts from Rp 10.000 (if I'm not mistaken). it's like a hidden place to relax and grab a coffee and read a book.

Had wanted to try the batagor, but suddenly it wasn't comfortable with the t4, the service was jutek - perfunctory, not clean, there wasn't a restroom/km... Still better at the food court next door (cleaner - friendly service - more menu choices)

It's kinda tricky to find this place, since there is no big signage outside, only a small door with japan-like decorations. You can park your vehicle by the street side.

It looks so narrow from outside, but when you go in, it's pretty spacious. They have izakaya-street decoration, and numerous of neon lights. Main space is smoking area, but they have separated non-smoking area as well. The vibe is so loud with hip-hop music, and it fits the decoration so well.

They mainly sell alcoholic beverages, but don't worry, they also provide non alcoholic. Their cocktail was good, all drinks were good on my visit. Quite cheap, -+30k/cup for cocktail. Very recommended.

A brand new place in a center of Malang City, strategic place with easy road access.
Great place to hangout and drink with friends, it has very nice concept and decoration. You can feel really different ambience downstairs, makes you lost track in time. There will be no difference ambience between day and night, amazing isn't it? Not only they have very nice place, they also provide you with extraordinary food and drinks. Loud music is a plus to this kind of vibe, cant complain. ü§ô

definitely not my usual kind of scene ü§£ i personally cant stand being there for too long since its placed underground and a lot of people smokes there, its very stuffy. the snack is great though and the drink is okay!

New experience for hangout.
The cafe with downtown of Tokyo's vibes

The Place
The entrance soooooo small. I even passing the place twice to make sure of it.
So many LEDs to take a picture with. Great vibes
Unfortunately, not for people who come to chitchat with friends, because the music is too loud for me.

The Taste
The Miso Ramen taste sooo good. The Drink also good and fancy.

The Price
Reasonable. You can get the fancy dish for around 20k-50k

The Service
The service is ok. The waiter and cashier are so friendly

Yoo this place was very awesome and very interesting concept I like it very much, just like their name place ‚ÄúDowntown‚Äù yep it was underground and just like pub but they sell coffee amd that was very unique taste.

As soon as I walked in, I was struck by the charming Chinese-themed decor, complete with an impressive collection of antiquities and old photographs of Indonesian landmarks.

The ambiance of the cafe was simply amazing with the old grandma style house and interiors, full of wooden style furniture that added to the overall charm of the place. The windows provided a stunning view of the nearby stream, accompanied by the soothing sound of flowing water. It was the most unique cafe I have ever been to, and I was immediately taken aback by the tranquility and serenity of the surroundings.

The menu was equally impressive, offering a range of delicious food and beverages. I tried their pisang bakar and it was one of the best I've ever had. The rate of the menu is very cheap as well.

All in all, I would highly recommend this cafe to anyone looking for a unique and memorable experience. The ambiance, the food, and the service are all outstanding, making it an ideal place to relax and unwind. I look forward to visiting again soon!

The decoration is superb, it's like an oriental museum. Perfect for someone who loves antique or unique building and someone who loves taking photo. The water sound came from the river and the fish pond make a relaxing ambiance. But sadly, there is no smoking room in this cafe so the visitor can smoking everywhere and it's make me uncomfortable. The taste of main menu is so so and a little bit salty. The tea is good tho. The price is really affordable

This place has so many beautiful spot, including the theme, building style which have unique design both the building and the interior (antique things), the garden, the fish pool and it‚Äôs surroundings that so homey, was really good for instagram and heaven for people who love taking picture. Foods and beverages was average enough. My two cents of this place would be the connection both menus and the ambiece, because the menus not-that-oriental antique, contradicts enough with the ambience.

Good vibes cafe with such a good books collection like Yuval Noah Harari's books. Not that pricey also. The menu's price ranged from around Rp. 10.000 - Rp. 30.000

Oriental style ~look like museum~ coffee shop with lots of antique stuffs inside. Menu is vary, especially light meal with very affordable price. Best table to sit is next to window where you can see a small river and bamboo trees. Collections bit dusty that are supposed to be well maintained to keep the existence."

Well, this place is not so spacious though. It's rather small for a cafe located downtown. But as long as you come at the right hours where the crowd is considerably minimum, then you will get a nice ambience instead. Meanwhile, as usual, I tried their latte. It was good enough. But their platter which consists of fried broccoli, kind of mushroom, potatl wedges and fried tofu was incredible. It's tasty and the sauce has some kind of unique sweet taste.

Visit this place after it got promoted by a local IG food reviewer. Nothing's special about this coffeeshop. Price are a bit expensive for that size of coffee. Dish needs forever to be served. Can't find a non-smoking table, unless those one outside.

I like the ambience, the drinks are great. I ordered strawberry creamy and ice coffee mantra. The strawberry creamy is basically like strawberry milk with the exact sweetness based on my likes. The ice coffee mantra, which is specialty in this cafe, but I think isn't special because the taste is like basic ice coffee milk *imo*.
The place is great for hang out with your friends, but not really great for those of you who want to be alone, because it's pretty crowded.

Location: 5/5 (easy to find.)
Place: 3/5 (great interior, I like the wall painting and painting in a frame, very creative. But I think, the cafe should put more ventilation, because sometimes customers are smoke in the indoor room. I found it pretty stuffy for indoor room)
Price: 4/5 (affordable prices according to the quality of the food)

Aesthetic place with limited menu to choose. Food is fair-priced considering the quantity and taste. Air circulation is problematic if you sit inside in a humid, hot weather and smoking area is basically everywhere. Waiter, cook, and barista are all very welcoming. Worth the visit with group of friends, but not intimate place for couples.

A nice place to hang out... Good coffee
But the upstair can be crazily crowded, which makes my head ache somehow. I think if don't like that kind of situation, take the outdooor seats on the back

Good coffee- reasonable price - good ambiance-good service- serve a free water.

Cozy place to spend time with partner or friends, the price it's standard and the taste also, there is parking area you should pay 2k/motocycle, there is smoking area, they sell coffe with plastic cup, I hope in the future this shop does not provide plastic cup and plastic staws also, go green !

Want to explore the menu again here! what makes the difference the most is because there is a pok pok booth hehe. The place is really comfortable for work.

Can you suggest a menu, please, what to try, yesterday I tried legit coffee but it's still too bitter for me ü§§

The coffee menu is really recommended, it doesn't make stomach acid even though it's strong. Here also available a variety of pastries and snack staples. There is also a coworking space on the 2nd floor.

The newest Starbucks in town, and the first Starbucks which provides drive thru in Malang. If you want to dine-in, don't worry. It's really spacious. The location is not really difficult to find. Let's say it's in the main road in Malang.

The location is a row of cafes.
The parking is wide.

It just seems unkempt. The location is in front of Sarijan Cafe. Very spacious inside, perfect for assignments and meetings.

If you say it's instagramable, in my opinion 7/10 depending on the motto, you have to have flat angels.

Service... it seems the staff is minimal, so it's not optimal, when I went there in the afternoon before maghrib. That's it, there's no food. Drinking is also limited.

There are toilets and mushollah, just like that, I want to go to the toilet and the mushollah is really not clean, heaps of piles of gt. The toilets are clean, the mushollah needs to be cleaned especially for prayer.

If cleanliness is not maintained and the quality of the food is not improved, you are worried that you will go out of business, especially since there are so many cafes around that are much cleaner and cheaper and taste good.

Cheap and pretty good. But like other modern coffee shops, the coffee taste is less strong and tends to be sweet.

The place is cozy for hanging out, the menu is also cheap. But delicious"

Always love the place to stop for coffee and snack, located inside the Mall of Olympic Garden,  this cafe has so many good snack and food. And especially their coffee are really indonesian  authenticity

Excelso standard place, separate between smoking and not smoking, but the place feels a little cramped.The dishes served are delicious. Coffee served is according to Excelso standards.Prices according to taste

Serving coffee, snacks and some meals, this is a good place for small gathering with your friends or family members. In terms of pricing, Excelso is on a more expensive side, but customers get what they pay for. Their staffs are very accomodating and will inform you about discounts or special offer. We paid 25K for their frappio (frappucino) with promo code from Line. Wifi is reliable (simply ask Excelso staffs for its password)

Great and cozy place to stay. There is smoking area outside and the crew is so nice! You got what you pay for, totally worth it."

Actually its gonna be a late review cause i've been here for like a month ago. Ok next, so from my opinion is Sudut Coffee is just like others coffee shop startup like a plain concrete chair, small rock in the floor, you know what it is. But it is not a bad thing nor a good things. For the coffee its the same thing but here they serve their signature jamaican something i kind a forget, and i belive its mixed with some rum, but correct me if im wrong. The last things is the cookies which is good, i like it. Overall its okay for me.

Good place and cozy, the baverages taste good but nothing special, the price is standard

Coffee - conversations; or just online gaming with friends cannot be separated.  Sudut Coffee is one of the meeting points for students, workers, and colleagues who want to spend time together, or just doing task.  Sudut Coffee serves you with selected menu at affordable prices.  Wifi are available. An interesting offer is Morning Coffee-time, starts at 08.00 - 11.00 pm just for IDR 10.000,

good for doing stuff like homework/assignments, coffee time or spend some time with friends or loved ones. they need to separate between non smoking area and smoking area. because some of my friends are allergic with smoke"

You can try to relax with friends/girlfriends. But it's a shame to go there because I just don't know what the menu and the place are. But it's a pretty cool place. And for the menu, because I happened to be there after eating, I just wanted to ice it so I didn't try the coffee. The snacks are pretty good too. It may be a confused choice to have coffee and spend time around there because there are many choices. Oh yes, the minus here is that there are a lot of buskers at night, so you have to be prepared for a lot of change.

Nice. On the edge of the rice fields, unfortunately the fields are not visible because it is night. The coffee is bali and there is gayo. The price is according to the pocket, it doesn't break. Various snacks and there are noodles. Saturday night and Sunday night it's crowded.

A decent place to cob for coffee and hang out looking for ideas to build a nation.

A very cozy place to have a small or deep talk with friends.
The non-smoking area is on the 1st floor while the 2nd floor is for smoking area (open space).

The staffs are sooo nice explaining this n that.
The drinks n food are varied

I love the ambiance and the friendly waiters, the avocado coffee was superb, the summer on the snow (drink) was so fresh and not to sour, although the fettucine carbonara a bit dry not creamy. The price is on the higher side. Oh they didn't turn on the air conditioning on the 2nd floor before 12pm but when i came to visit it's not a hot sunny day so there not much problem, but if it's hot outside it's definitely gonna be a trouble.

Really nice place to get relax here, good foods taste, friendly prices for me..try it, you won't regret it

the place is decent, the employees are many, the food is also not bad, the drinks that I ordered are also okay

there was a message
fried noodles, boiled noodles, rainbow toast, cheese toast, roasted corn, taro pure milk ice, chocolate milkshake, ginger wedang, chocolate ice, warm orange

I think the taro milk doesn't taste like the milk, but it takes a long time to taste the taro, that's it, the chocolate milkshake is okay, then the rainbow toast color is like that ü§£ at first, you can see it on tiktok, the color is really pretty, but it's worth it the price is good, but for those who like a lot of stuffing, it's perfect, if you like standard, it'll be bad because there's a lot of stuffing, but the grilled corn is also delicious, it's been printed one by one so it's easier to eat, the onion rings are not bad either,

the service is okay, friendly and good too, maybe because it's a bit crowded, okay, for student pockets it's also worth it, but because it's a family here, it's okay, it's safe, and the location is next to the main road, so it's easy to find, that's okay , thankyou, success continues and maintain the service and taste

Roti Bakar Om Doel in Sawojajar, Malang is a place to eat that is worth a try for toast lovers. The price offered is very affordable, so you don't need to worry about spending a lot of money. The taste of the toast here is very delicious and satisfying, especially with the variety of toppings that you can choose according to your taste.

This dining area is also quite spacious and has a comfortable atmosphere, so it is perfect for enjoying toast with family or friends. Unfortunately, the service here is rather slow and unsatisfactory. However, this does not reduce the quality and taste of the toast offered.

In general, Roti Bakar Om Doel is a place to eat that is worth a try for toast lovers with affordable prices and delicious taste. However, there are still a number of things that need to be improved, such as rather long service."

couple month ago my frend tell me about coffe he bring from this shop and say ""the taste is nice and intruguing"" ..so today i visited this shop.. and ""yes"" it was..and ""more""..
this.. i think is proper benchmarks about coffe shop, not just coffe and place for hang around,  this place give proper combination about mood, vintage place, vintage coffe, proper serving attitude,  proper  knowledge, proper chat until hit your levels of coffe geeky-ness.
i stand to say this ""don't let your mind limited your curiosity just because intimidating aura of atmosphere"", the serving attitude in this place just sublime, is proper and nice to everyone..today i came with parfume ""reek de sweat"" and they just serving me with nice, good, kind of servings

The softness of the moonlight is very ahoi. The taste of the martabak is also no less delicious.

There are many variations to choose from.. don't worry even if the 15k passport bag already has a special taste. Definitely satisfied.

Hello sir, I ordered by shopeefood moonlit special cheese. Why is it given chocolate cheese?? Who wants to eat this, sir? People with coughs may not eat chocolate, sir

Actually in terms of location, this cafe already has advantages & wins a lot. But seen from several other sides there are a number of things that are a minus value.

The positives: the location is very strategic, in the heart of the city / main wooden protocol road, access & parking right on the edge of the main road. From here, it's easy to go anywhere & surrounded by complete public facilities (ATMs, shops, etc.).

What is inconvenient: access from the 1st floor to the 3rd floor which is steep & not recommended for the elderly & children, even teenagers have to be careful so they don't slip, especially while carrying trays of coffee & snacks. The view of the city from the balcony is also not optimal because it is blocked by cables & electricity poles which are very crowded.

For variations in the price of drinks & snacks, it's not bad for a cafe in the city center area, even though it's still a bit burdensome for school children's pockets. Btw, the delicious cheese bread makes you full & the chocolate ice is fresh.
Maybe that's all for now... hopefully in the future it will be even better 24/12/22

One of the cafes located in the Kayutangan heritage area. The place is small but has 4 floors. Cozy enough to hang out.

The menu is quite diverse for a cafe. Try the gelato, it's pretty good. But the price is a bit pricey compared to other cafes in Malang."

The place is good if you take a sit-down break after shopping. Next to it there is an ATM and cheap ice cream. But for the concoctions it's not suitable, especially those that aren't coffee. Maybe you can test it again because to be honest it tastes weird especially the white lychee drink

They keep an eclectic mix of Indonesian tunes playing in the background.  We ordered the pisang goreng, brownie, green tea, water, and a Cold White Haze.  The pisang goreng is a delicious, sweet pastry type dish.  The green tea was delicious, and the Cold White Haze cold brew was a refreshing chocolate flavored cold coffee.

Subscribe to zeger at the office, the price is cheap and according to the pocket, the taste is really good, the chocolate is smudged, the service is fast and friendly too. You have to try all the flavors because they are really delicious. Ordering at efood is also cheap, lots of promos.

When you get the order, go straight to the tyta restaurant, it's already prepared, just give it ice and continue it, but that changes when a customer immediately buys it and waits for 30 minutes patiently waiting, when it's delivered to review and evaluate how good it is , equally delicious, arrogantly arrogantly challenging for a physical fight, (the new waiter is longish, fat) , please improve the service. We are not looking for enemies at work, the main thing is to be professional in all matters.

Right there, there were several mainstay menus that were empty, it was a shame. But still the favorite is still Choco Avocado.

The price is cheap but the taste is delicious, the gejrot tofu is delicious, the seasoning is a lot, the tofu is tasty. The drink menu is complete, the chocolate series and the coffee are delicious, the lime is fresh, the sweetness is just right if you order less ice less sugar üëçüëçüëçüëç"

An easy choice of coffee shop for those who needs a place to work from cafe! Clean places and plenty seat and power outlets for your time in front of laptop. It‚Äôs not as crowded as the other outlets so this one is better for me personally.

The newest Starbucks in town, and the first Starbucks which provides drive thru in Malang. If you want to dine-in, don't worry. It's really spacious. The location is not really difficult to find. Let's say it's in the main road in Malang.

Plus point for their nice, quiet and cozy ambience. But not a fan for what they serve. Coffee taste not so good, and their mashed potato is bland with no creamy taste at all. Or maybe I just pick the wrong dish? Improve your dishes and drink, and maybe I'll consider another visit.

Will definitely be my favourite coffee shop in Malang. The coffee is superb! Try pour over V60 Gayo wine beans. Sooo light and clear. And surprisingly, it's not really expensive for such a fragrant and tasty coffee. The place? So much greeny and peaceful. It's got a concept a vintage house. A house during Dutch colonization.

great coffee, they have in-house roastery, and you could buy roasted coffee beans there, and ask them to grind it if you didn't have grinder at home. the only minus for me, is the mushola looks so dirty, and hidden in the 2nd floor, and didn't really well kept & clean

but I do highly recommend the smoking / non-smoking room, for a casual or business meeting. I usually visit Labore after 19.00, their night vibe is also lovely.

Place review :
So this outlet has a unique and cool model in my opinion, it's more like a Korean theme ""alay like that, the seats use private material and the original is nice to look at but this material if it gets hit by rain it will rot and break
This outlet is staffed by mothers and children, the mother may be in charge of taking care of food such as donuts, waffles etc. while the cute and virgin part of the barista-style drinks, it's a shame the two of them don't wear cool uniforms like outlets"" the other one instead wears short shorts. wkwkwk üòÇ...(tomorrow just wear lingerie so it's badaasss), but they still feel clumsy in the halter eh not flexible when making the order process, the plus point is that the mother-child duo are friendly üôè, one more this outlet is more for take away as a table There are no chairs, there are only chairs for waiting for the order, only 2 birds

Food review: the drinks are manstab abiz semanstab the video is cut tari vs ariel noah... oops üôä, the process of making waffles and donuts takes quite a long time even though I saw them using modern equipment (I can imagine if you get a lot of orders it will definitely be more complicated and the process will be more delayed takes a long time...

That's all... warm greetings from Garangan Elegant

The coffee taste is strong, the quality is also the best. There are donuts & cirengnya also delicious. Keep up the quality & qualityüëåüèª

The coffee is delicious, the side dishes are also delicious, the prices are also reasonable, it's not surprising that talented artists have several times ordered drinks (especially coffee) from Daycinno, the best anyway

Special quality student prices"

Nice place

Came here with the intention of wanting to eat but it turned out that there was a lot of food that was not available. Only one knows the mayor. Since we've stopped by, we'll just have a drink. And I think it's normal. Just like a cafe to just drink casually or relax doing chores, not recommended for heavy meals. There are toilets and a prayer room.
The place is pretty clean and the service is friendly. It's just that there aren't many food menus. Hopefully in the future it will be improved.

In fact its location is in the middle of a village. You need to be very meticulous to find it. The house seems to be an old one, the one that hasn't gone through much renov. It is left almost as its original form. The furnishings are also vintage. The owner or the barrista, I am not sure which, is very friendly young man. I bought its signature, called Iced-Coffee Kane (delicious Iced-Coffee), which is creamy and strong.

One of the small local coffeeshop that makes me impressed. It's because their signature coffee taste differ from another coffeeshop in Malang. They are not only following the trend, but they pay attention to their quality. My favorite is Es Kopi Susu Kane, paired it with a freshly homemade donut. You have to try it.

'Drink coffee at home' is the concept of this place. Built in the barista/owner's own house, the ambience feels so homey, reminds me of my grandpa's home back in my hometown somehow. But still has a little touch of coffeeshop with a small bar in the corner. Has lots of coffee beans, from arabika to robusta. Tried their filtered tolu batak, latte, and es susu kopi (ice coffee milk), tasted good, made with manual machine. For a non coffee drinker, try the Galauincinno ice, their special recipe, a beverage made of milk, coffee, ice, and palm sugar! A unique one, but taste really good! Affordable price, from 5k to 20k.

You will never expect a coffee shop at a quite place like this, is really traditionally and vintage place with many kind of arabica and robusta coffee, you will be spoiled by the whole coffee things

Es Kopi Kane from this coffee shop has special and unique taste. Pricing is standard. Available for take away and delivery service from food delivery app."

Mayan prices are cheap for the size of the area where several hotels are located. Soto ordinary 10,000, rawon 15,000. And after ordering, it's recommended. The koyahnya koyah hakiki (roasted from grated coconut) so that the fresh, savory soup is even more savory. The 3,000 coffee is pretty good, thick and not too sweet. The milk coffee isn't really recommended: it's easy if the Javanese say, cuer there's no kick of coffee or milk. Maybe it's because the price is only 3000 times... My suggestion is to increase the price of milk coffee by 5000 but it tastes great, so it can give a good impression.

It's a nice tiny place with a huge deal of details. Feel the unique vibe and enjoy the afternoon catching up with friends.

Another Malang's hidden gem! Recommend this place for coffee lovers. Not a big place, and the location is quite far from Malang downtown, but the design is really interesting, kinda industrial, but has a homey vibe. And since it has an open bar setting, you can have coffee talk with the barista, Mas Pandu, also the owner of this coffee shop. Lataroma means house yard, which is literally built in the owner's house yard. Yang jadi ciri khas di sini adalah semuanya serba manual, mulai dari mesin roastingnya, espresso, sampai untuk steam susunya. Untuk yang bukan pecinta kopi, bisa coba menu matcha latte atau caramel latte yang cukup manis. Range harga mulai dari 15 ribu sampai 35 ribuan. Overall, tempat ini yang menyenangkan untuk dikunjungi.

Small place but the owner setting very well. Sourdough Sandwich and dessert all good.

LOVE PLACE BEST VIEWS

After not being here for a long time, I was surprised, it turned out that the cafe had been renovated in such a way. In the past this cafe was very simple with a sky roof and vines, now this cafe has turned into an aesthetic cafe with various ornaments. In the past, the outlets were only available at certain points, now the outlets are made evenly spread in almost every corner. The place is getting nicer and more comfortable, then the price is also still in the pocket of students. For the menu, then and now there have been many changes, even almost all of the menus are new menus. In the past, the heavy food menu was only indomie rice noodles, now the heavy food menu is quite varied and suitable to fill the stomach while enjoying the breeze in the afternoon. What I really miss about this place are the cute cats. There used to be a jet black village cat whose voice was very cute and made me miss. Yesterday when I visited again unfortunately did not meet the black cat. Really recommended this place

The place is comfortable. It is recommended to come here at night with friends. The most delicious place lesehannya. In addition to the availability of wifi, there is also a wall socket for those who want to charge their cellphones or laptops at the sitting area. You can read contemporary books at the cross-legged area and you can borrow a guitar or a card from the receptionist/cashier to play with friends."

Standard low budget caffe, be carefull if you go to this caffe when rain because some roof has a leak.

My favourite beverages is its iced mocca latte. They serve it with marshmallow on top of it!

And their steak is sooo tender and juicy. Yummm..

Cozy, Monochrome, and Affordable...

The concept raised is monochrome (simple black and white).

The hangout location this time is on Jalan Kadaka. Very close to ""Provincial road"" Soekarno Hatta road, Malang. less than 5 minutes from the main road before reaching Dan's Kitchen.

Before entering, there is a sweetener on Dan's right and left wall designs that you can use to take pictures/selfies etc. In the form of flowers with a choice of beautiful colors.

The facilities provided are also quite complete. Free Wifi, AC room, toilet, prayer room and a representative parking lot as well as power plugs. Indoor and outdoor table options are also available. Whether you come with work friends or just the two of you with your loved ones, everything is facilitated at Dan's Kitchen.

The menu choices are very modern and friendly to students, which is the main target of Dan's kitchen. Heavy meals, snacks, soups and drinks are also quite diverse.

There is always something that can be improved at this hangout location, you can add a choice of delivery providers such as (go-jek, grab, etc.) and a pointer to a restaurant on the side of the road.

A few reviews from me.
Thank you Dan's Kitchen for being the host this time.

Hopefully it will continue to be better and be able to add to the uniqueness of the culinary visit of the city of Malang"

Love the atmosphere and the food.
It is worth the price. And it is quite cheap compare to other cafes in Malang.

However, it took soooo much time for the food to be ready. Maybe because it's always crowded with people.
Also, they played the music so loud. So you might reconsider to visit this place if you like a quiet place. But they also provide a special room for study or work, so you might use that.

Don't ride a car to visit this place, it's hard to find the parking lot.

Semusim Cafe is on St. MT. Haryono Malang, exactly across from Brawijaya University. This cafe has two floors which are always busy every day with visitors who are mostly students. This cafe sells cheap food and drinks so it is suitable for student pockets, prices start from 7,000 to 20,000. This cafe is open every day, open from 10.00 to 00.00. This cafe has a Scandinavian decoration concept so it is very interesting to visit. and apart from that this cafe also has air-conditioned first floor facilities, there are sockets on each table without worrying about running out of battery, as well as a prayer room for Muslim visitors. Meanwhile, the second floor is a smoking zone as well as a place to carry out tasks. This floor cafe is non-AC, it won't feel hot because of the lots of ventilation and the use of fans to provide extra comfort to visitors.

Price is so affordable. Taste is okay not so extraordinary, only got the problem with too much sweetness for the drink. Place is well and nice, so comfy and having a decent interior.

Strategically located accross the uni. Very affordable price, cute interior, nice ambience (although mostly very crowded), food taste exceeds my expectations."

Crispy breaded bananas on the outside, sweet and soft bananas on the inside. Attractive packaging, the box is equipped with a fork and uses safety adhesive, neat.

C321 Nusantara Tobacco Cafe. A comfortable place to try rolling tobacco while drinking coffee. Many testers of various kinds of tobacco. The price of coffee and snacks is very affordable for student pockets.

Great coffee....lots of tobacco testers of various flavors, very friendly coffee prices. Just right for hanging out in the afternoon and evening with friends while smoking tobacco

Cheap, lively...student prices...as much as you like, testers are satisfied, we are weak...whahhaha"

The place is in the corner next to Timezone, the mas and mbk are friendly, for a good taste the iced coffee milk isn't bitter, you can pay using ovo too

Coffee promises the soul of one of the coffee hits. In Malang there are several branches. There are various kinds of coffee such as milk coffee, chocolate, cocopresso, black coffee, soy matcha latte. There are also those without coffee such as matcha milk, yuzu yogurt, hojicha milk, grass jelly milk. For toppings, there are grass jelly, extra espresso, matcha ice cream, vanilla ice cream, pearl. Prices are standard with other places.

One of the modern coffee shop in Malang city. It is located on the 2nd floor of Malang Toen Square, right in the corner close to the time zone. The shop is quite small. There are only two small tables here, so it will be very difficult for you to enjoy coffee on the spot. Serves a variety of processed coffee and tea.

The place is quite cozy and cool blended with a malang city atmosphere and adds a safe feeling when sitting and spending time there. There are so many open spaces to talk with friends. The drink also tastes good. Motorcycle parking cost Rp 2000.

I've never been there... but for a village area like overlapping, it doesn't seem too familiar. We can make our own coffee at home. I also observed that the place was not crowded with visitors. Maybe because it's still new

The place is clean, the place is comfortable, the bathroom is clean, the parking area is spacious, the employees are friendly and there are many more advantages in this hangout place and on the other hand the price is also quite affordable for a hangout place with various kinds of processed coffee which is very delicious at very affordable prices and maybe this is the only place to hang out in the Malang Regency area for the eastern region with the most delicious coffee I've ever found. processed coffee that is very delicious ok That's all and really recommend it for visiting this place and don't forget to review it and also share it with friends So that more and more people know about this place and always make Mariana coffee, thank you"

Beautiful place, with very friendly and helpful staff on duty. For foreigners do spray mosquito repellant first as this place decorated with potted plants and trees, expect to donate a few ounces of your blood.

Price is considered normal for a cafe, give them a try if you are looking for a place to relax and gather photo content.

If you are a coffee addict, I suggest that you order a hand brew, about 4 beans profile for you to choose from. My feedback is that they consider upgrading their espresso machine and grinder for better shots and milk frothing. Not a fair comment maybe cause I have high expectations over espresso base coffee.

As my company, I chose mocha latte which surprisingly tasted so good. But that's before I ate my Nasi Goreng Warisan. It was so great. For such a price, I was so satisfied. I would definitely revisit this cafe.

Pak Ran's coffee is a legendary place from the time of the assistant work at Matahari PBS to the place where you skip high school, where you talk about arema, politics, complete household complaints in this place to be discussed.

The menu choices are not adventurous. Black Coffee, Milk Coffee, Ginger Coffee and Tea. Some militant customers here sometimes refer to it as Kopi Hitam as Kopi Lanang, and Kopi Wedok as Kopi Susu.
For friends enjoying coffee, various traditional snacks are served such as brontak tofu, fried bananas, tempe mendoan, and gandos that will add to the enjoyment of your coffee.

I was here for late lunch and the weather was amazing, I decided to dine in upstairs with air breeze in Malang.
I've ordered Dahayu Tea and the taste was refreshing, its taste sour and sweet smell, just like berries does.

Hospitality was amazing. I enjoyed the quick order proses with the staff and I did not mind to go downstaird to pick up my order and went back again upstairs.

But the meal, I was so sad I had to feel disappointed with this food, the asparagus chicken.
Chicken was served in a hotplate and I hardly wait to try with sauce.

Chicken was hot.
But the sauce was cold as fff, same with the mini croquet and veggies.

I do not know what was going on that day, but all part of meals should served hot. But not for the sauce, even when I mixed the cold sauce and hot chicken, its meal temperature lowering to room tempie.

Not bad at a price of only Rp. 7,000.-, that's enough. You can add meatball pentol, you can buy it through go food & grab food. Unfortunately the place is narrow so it looks shabby, pressing with the road too. So if parking is a bit difficult. Only enough 3 motorcycles.

The coffee served at the coffee shop ""PORTAL COFFEE MALANG"" is coffee from the Malang region. There are Arabica coffees such as Arjuno, Kawi, Parangtedjo, and Selorejo Dau. Then there is Robusta coffee which is a mainstay, namely SRIDONORETNO (DAMPIT) coffee.

Previously, Portal Coffee Malang was one location with The Roots Barbershop Malang. But now the two have moved to separate locations near the old place. The most favorite here is of course the processed coffee. In the afternoon, visitors can also see the coffee roasting process for themselves. There are various types of robusta and arabica coffee beans on offer. Starting from Malang local products and several other areas. Good preparations include palm sugar milk coffee, brewed coffee, V60, afogato, and others. For those who don't like coffee, there are choices of traditional drinks such as wedang uwuh, nasi kencur and turmeric tamarind. Quality and taste to be reckoned with."

Unfortunately I had the bad experience with the meal here.
I was here for late lunch and the weather was amazing, I decided to dine in upstairs with air breeze in Malang.
I've ordered Dahayu Tea and the taste was refreshing, its taste sour and sweet smell, just like berries does.

Hospitality was amazing. I enjoyed the quick order proses with the staff and I did not mind to go downstaird to pick up my order and went back again upstairs.

But the meal, I was so sad I had to feel disappointed with this food, the asparagus chicken.
Chicken was served in a hotplate and I hardly wait to try with sauce.

Chicken was hot.
But the sauce was cold as fff, same with the mini croquet and veggies.

I do not know what was going on that day, but all part of meals should served hot. But not for the sauce, even when I mixed the cold sauce and hot chicken, its meal temperature lowering to room tempie.

Not good.

Nothing impressed me beside the view of railroads and train passing by. Place are quite a mess and crowded. Coffee's no good at all (compared to those average coffee shops nearby, with same price). Only tried the snacks, and I really lost for words to describe (in a bad way). Not to mention it took nearly 45 minutes to get my order ready. The highlight is, I saw rat running around. Yep, definitely will never coming back.

coffee shop with a view of the train tracks. in my opinion the price is relatively expensive when compared to the taste served.

The taste was okay. But i dont think it's worth the price, cause the portion was small.
They have indoor and outdoor setting. But the indoor was to dark and gloomy. The only good thing was the outdoor (cause you can see the train), but you will absolutely can't use it if it were raining outside.
They played the music out loud to the point of annoying. I spend time to work there, and have a meeting. But they didn't even bother to decrease the volume.
And don't forget the music wasn't suite the cafe vibes.
And also lots of mosquito, if you stay there past 5pm.

Hope the cafe improve its quality, vibes and service.

Nice place for alone or family.
The right place for bring the kid to see train. Lovely vibes.

We found this place by coincidence on a Saturday about 8pm and we found it pretty comfy,  they have an extended good menu and beer. About 100 meters from the Malang Train station. Friendly servers; they speak English and the menu is in English (not that correct English but understandable). We also have some snacks and they were delicious. Prices aren't as expensive as a fancy hotel nearby, but not as cheap as local prices either, resonable prices. I would recommend this place if you stop by Malang for a night or two and are looking for a place where to eat and have some drinks."

If you say it's instagramable, in my opinion 7/10 depending on the motto, you have to have flat angels.

Service... it seems the staff is minimal, so it's not optimal, when I went there in the afternoon before maghrib. That's it, there's no food. Drinking is also limited.

There are toilets and mushollah, just like that, I want to go to the toilet and the mushollah is really not clean, heaps of piles of gt. The toilets are clean, the mushollah needs to be cleaned especially for prayer.

If cleanliness is not maintained and the quality of the food is not improved, you are worried that you will go out of business, especially since there are so many cafes around that are much cleaner and cheaper and taste good.

The place is decent I would say, I especially loved the interior and outdoor settings. The cafe has transformed the dutch building with blue and white stylings. Quite different what you easily see, for me the architecture stand out when I was driving my motorcycle, piqued my curiosity.
The coffee was fine, not the best. Expecting the manual V60 Japanese brew to be more delicate but it‚Äôs mainly depend on the barista to bring out the taste.

I think this is one of those cafes where you can spend time chatting with a group of friends. Well, it's great for couples too but I think the vibe is not so much suitable for that.
First time at Hindia, we ordered hazelnut latte, some kind of tea and their platter menu. Well, I can't say something special about those three menus.
But I think they need to reconsider putting away those tables placed on the outer side of the outdoor area.

It is a coffee shop and eatery as well. Coffee is basically prepared from a group of selected beans with a coffee machine; so there is nothing special. The menu is rather complete, offering main dishes and snacks. The price is affordable and the location is strategic.

Good beverages. I ordered avocado coffee and it's pretty okay-ish. The food surprisingly came out really good. We ordered kwetiau and banana fritters. The kwetiau was great, meanwhile the banana was okay. The place overall was comfortable, but the service wasn't that great.

Actually its gonna be a late review cause i've been here for like a month ago. Ok next, so from my opinion is Sudut Coffee is just like others coffee shop startup like a plain concrete chair, small rock in the floor, you know what it is. But it is not a bad thing nor a good things. For the coffee its the same thing but here they serve their signature jamaican something i kind a forget, and i belive its mixed with some rum, but correct me if im wrong. The last things is the cookies which is good, i like it. Overall its okay for me.

Good place and cozy, the baverages taste good but nothing special, the price is standard

Coffee - conversations; or just online gaming with friends cannot be separated.  Sudut Coffee is one of the meeting points for students, workers, and colleagues who want to spend time together, or just doing task.  Sudut Coffee serves you with selected menu at affordable prices.  Wifi are available. An interesting offer is Morning Coffee-time, starts at 08.00 - 11.00 pm just for IDR 10.000,

good for doing stuff like homework/assignments, coffee time or spend some time with friends or loved ones. they need to separate between non smoking area and smoking area. because some of my friends are allergic with smoke"

First time coming here and I wasn‚Äôt impressed with what they offered on paper. Or perhaps because I‚Äôve spent considerable amount of emotional cost just to find the location. It was barely visible from the busy street on that Saturday night. However, it only took one bite to calibrate my frustrated mind cause the food was fantastic. My brother and I tried three dishes and my entire mouth was gladly participating. Chicken was tender. Beef was tender and super moist. Seasoning was on point. I don‚Äôt know about the rest of the menu tho. I‚Äôll come back later.

I have no complaint for anything about the food. It taste good, fair portion for the price. Waiters are all giving their best service. I just not really enjoy the ambience. I don't get the concept. It's too formal to be a cafe, but it's too loud and casual to be a fine dining place. I hope they could work this out, because i love their Nasi Seafood Siram Woku and looking forward to have another dine in.

Good food, big portion, and clean place. Although the price is expensive, the taste and the portion are worthed. The service is very welcome. I can say ""it is one of the best restaurant in Malang"".

Good food, even I can say the price is so cheap for delicious and  cool plating ..

The food is okay (although it was served not quite warm) but the service is very bad. First, you have to wait a long time for your food. Secondly, I don't understand why tourists have to pay in advance when Indonesians can pay just like in any decent restaurant, after eating a meal, just before leaving.
I don't really know what the reason is, is it racism against white people?
If you are trying to copy European/American standards then improve your customer service because unfortunately you don't have much chance to attract more customers with this behavior.
It's a pity because you could have found yourself in a large guide about Indonesia and now you will become viral on TikTok.
Unfortunately, you are the worst restaurant we ate at during our Southeast Asia trip."

The eggs have been washed first. Every time I buy stmj, martabak, fried rice or all foods made from eggs, I usually don't wash the eggs first so that when cooking, the seller's hands hold the eggs which still have dirt on them. Maybe the reason is that eggs are not easy to stir. But whatever the reason, this of course affects the halalness of the food.
But here the eggs are clean, there is no adhering dirt. It means that the eggs here are holy and unclean. I'm sure STMJ Yassalam is guaranteed to be halal.

Thanks, yassalam, poor poor, actually the taste...the spices taste in the body, the feeling of aches and pains is gone, especially the special one...it's bad luck to drink here...I'm disappointed. It's free, the wifi is clean, the place is clean...the egg milk is normal The fishy smell doesn't smell good....the main thing is...stemj yassalam, opening in Malang is just right because there's been a lot of it so far...now it's here in Malang, the taste is solid...the milk is thick, not runny. ... there is no loss here ... and the price is cheap .... great, jossss, gandooooossss, wesssss .....

After exploring many coffee shops, I found one coffee shop which I think is really worth it for students like us to visit üòÄ.  Nakoa cafe Bondowoso is one of my favorite hangout cafes, it seems I have visited this cafe countless times.  The reason why Nakoa is my favorite cafe is that most of the people who come here are students doing their assignments, so it makes the atmosphere of the cafe calm and not chaotic.  The people at Nakoa also don't care about visitors, so I think Nakoa is really good for me time.  My favorite menu here is the matcha latte üíö.  Apart from the matcha latte, the drinks here are also delicious.  The price is also standard, which is under 25,000.  Apart from selling drinks, here they also sell some delicious food, moreover, the donuts are really delicious and cheap üòÉ.  For those of you who like to do assignments alone, you can really try this Nakoa cafe.

The place so comfy for works both indoor and outdoor, the coffee is great too. WiFi so fast, the staff so friendly, i have a good experience at Nakoa Cafe, just need some improvement to make the toilet clean. Overall is good, i'll come again to Nakoa Cafe. Waiting for the new menu for filling my tummy.

This is a special place for co-working which makes it also a great coffee shop. Italian espresso machine Simonelli makes nice coffees and you feel like being in a sort of modern museum. Really outstanding design....well done!

Suitable for family hangouts because you don't have to go far to town. The location is convenient but when it's busy the service is a bit long because there are only a few employees, and there is no music as entertainment. There is a prayer room and clean bathrooms. The menu is diverse. Prices start at IDR 5,000 for drinks and for food, prices start at IDR 10,000.
It seems there is no wifi. To taste like a cafe.

Recommended to visit when passing or in Malang City, Sukun Village Area.

Not only delicious and comfortable for young people but also for mothers both for social gatherings or friendship among friends, a comfortable place for gentlemen to drink coffee in the afternoon or at night.

Serving various drinks & food and the prices are overall affordable.

The place is spacious, good for hanging out in the afternoon or evening. But hot days are not good.
The menu consists of noodles. For food taste 6/10
What is lacking here is cleanliness. For food it looks open even though it is arranged around the stove. So this is like an ingredient that is about to be cooked and is surrounded by flies. Hopefully in the future please pay attention to cleanliness. Because what goes into the stomach is important. Also, please store the vegetables properly. Because when I eat vegetables it looks bad."

Well, this place is not so spacious though. It's rather small for a cafe located downtown. But as long as you come at the right hours where the crowd is considerably minimum, then you will get a nice ambience instead. Meanwhile, as usual, I tried their latte. It was good enough. But their platter which consists of fried broccoli, kind of mushroom, potatl wedges and fried tofu was incredible. It's tasty and the sauce has some kind of unique sweet taste.

Visit this place after it got promoted by a local IG food reviewer. Nothing's special about this coffeeshop. Price are a bit expensive for that size of coffee. Dish needs forever to be served. Can't find a non-smoking table, unless those one outside.

I like the ambience, the drinks are great. I ordered strawberry creamy and ice coffee mantra. The strawberry creamy is basically like strawberry milk with the exact sweetness based on my likes. The ice coffee mantra, which is specialty in this cafe, but I think isn't special because the taste is like basic ice coffee milk *imo*.
The place is great for hang out with your friends, but not really great for those of you who want to be alone, because it's pretty crowded.

Location: 5/5 (easy to find.)
Place: 3/5 (great interior, I like the wall painting and painting in a frame, very creative. But I think, the cafe should put more ventilation, because sometimes customers are smoke in the indoor room. I found it pretty stuffy for indoor room)
Price: 4/5 (affordable prices according to the quality of the food)

Aesthetic place with limited menu to choose. Food is fair-priced considering the quantity and taste. Air circulation is problematic if you sit inside in a humid, hot weather and smoking area is basically everywhere. Waiter, cook, and barista are all very welcoming. Worth the visit with group of friends, but not intimate place for couples.

Help the male employees who wear glasses be more educated about ethics. I didn't talk to him, instead I joined in with the old way.

This is the first time a coffee employee has memories like this. Usually it's just fine, friendly and enjoy... uh this is a guy but his mouth is like a girl's just scowling when someone is talking.

If you still maintain employees like that... I can report to the CONSUMER PROTECTION FOUNDATION for the unpleasant behavior of the employees.

I hope that the big name KOPI KENANGAN is supported by employees who have good ethics.

Thanks

Here the coffee tastes different from other memorable coffees, the body is too bold, too strong, seems to use a different blend of coffee, like using robusta coffee, or maybe it was just a one time accident when I ordered it in the morning via ojol.

Try it for the first time and order via grabfood. This time, the order is iced coffee from memories of the former + iced chocolate runaway. The iced coffee from this former memory tastes okay for me, who doesn't really like coffee, taste 8/10. But for the big no ice chocolate, the taste is far from expectations. Compared to pure cocoa, it has ch*time so much taste. Taste 7/10.

The coffee is pretty good... The price is also comfortable in the 18k pocket for a latte

For toppings, you can ask for more.. toppings with bubbles, Oreos and a few others... Usually around 6k per topping."

After exploring many coffee shops, I found one coffee shop which I think is really worth it for students like us to visit üòÄ.  Nakoa cafe Bondowoso is one of my favorite hangout cafes, it seems I have visited this cafe countless times.  The reason why Nakoa is my favorite cafe is that most of the people who come here are students doing their assignments, so it makes the atmosphere of the cafe calm and not chaotic.  The people at Nakoa also don't care about visitors, so I think Nakoa is really good for me time.  My favorite menu here is the matcha latte üíö.  Apart from the matcha latte, the drinks here are also delicious.  The price is also standard, which is under 25,000.  Apart from selling drinks, here they also sell some delicious food, moreover, the donuts are really delicious and cheap üòÉ.  For those of you who like to do assignments alone, you can really try this Nakoa cafe.

The place so comfy for works both indoor and outdoor, the coffee is great too. WiFi so fast, the staff so friendly, i have a good experience at Nakoa Cafe, just need some improvement to make the toilet clean. Overall is good, i'll come again to Nakoa Cafe. Waiting for the new menu for filling my tummy.

This is a special place for co-working which makes it also a great coffee shop. Italian espresso machine Simonelli makes nice coffees and you feel like being in a sort of modern museum. Really outstanding design....well done!

My kinda go-to coffeeshop. Not so crowded, affordable price for a quite good coffee, free parking. Not so much on the menu to offered, but I think it's just simple. Would love to have another visit to try their pastries.
Update : I tried their pastries. But I think I'd skip it next time.

A little coffe shop at Malang city. Worth to visit. Self roast coffee beans, roasted by its owner. There are Arabica and Robusta variety, which came from Pantan Terong, Lintong, Kenya, Wamena, also Kintamani, and others..

They have La Mian and also Rice Bowl for big menu. Pastry, Toast Bread, Friench Fries, and other elses for the snacks.

Friendly price, good service and wide parking space.

Delicious Lamian in town!! I didnt need to add soy sauce or chili sauce because the flavor is very umami. I ordered Mie Kuah Pangsit and Tahu Walik. The Tahu Walik is filled with real meatüíñ!. Unfortunately, I gave 4 stars because the service was very slow and they didn't clean the unused cutlery in my table until my food came (this isn't self service restaurant). So I ate my food while there was still unused cutlery in my table, I had to ask the waiter 2 times to take the unused cutlery.  Hope they'd improve the service quality better in the near future üòÅ

cheapest yet the most creamy coffee that i ever tasted.

One of the coffeeshops in Malang. The location is very strategic, close to campus. located on Jalan Raya Manunggal Sudimoro Malang City.

This place comes with an interesting concept. The place is also very spacious. Inside and to the side there are also flowers. The place is fun and very comfortable. There are indoor and outdoor areas which are both spacious and comfortable. Also there is an area above the 2nd floor which is very spacious.

The menu at this Coffeeshop varies both coffee and non-coffee and the prices are pocket-friendly. Good service. So for that, friends who want to drink coffee or hang out with friends. This place can be an option if you are in Malang.

I like the coffee, chill if I'm not mistaken (9/10)
Cookies (9/10) because it's fat and has chocolate filling in it
Churros with Tiramisu Sauce (9/10)
And my friend's cold drink I don't know how it tastes because I can't drink cold anymore
Instagrammable, friends
You can park the car in front of it or go a little further on the right side of the road, under a tree if you want it's better

Java Dancer located in a quiet residential area. It is small enough to seat about 15 people, and the interior is as cute as its pretty name. Even though it is early for dinner, there are 7-8 locals seated. Ordered a salad and chicken for coffee and a light meal. Quantity is more than expected. Delicious coffee and food. But Salad is so salty.

After a hot day wandering lost and stressed around Malang, this was such a relaxing place to cool off. We felt so happy and relaxed in this beautiful shop, surrounded by plants and the sound of bubbling water.

They have single origin coffees from around Indonesia, which can be brewed in five different ways. This was fun to tour. We tried the Kintamani brewed in a siphon, which was mild, with a mango juice they prepared with 100% mango and cream. So refreshing! It's a little expensive as they have some extra charges for certain taxes, which was explained in the menu. Just don't be surprised by the bill.

The ambiance is the strongest point, along with a great menu of drinks and food.

Cosy open air caf√© with extensive menu for both international and local food! We came here for the espressos and they really hit the spot! We indulged on an affogato and ginger latte as well as some delicious pancakes and roti bantal with chocolate!

Wonderful decor and experience for a foreigner like me to see the batik, masks and other traditional puppets. We went between meals but The food looked amazing and I would love to go back and try it.

Got there for just take some coffee..
Ordered hot cappuccino with extra shoot..They used their specialty house blend coffee..

Ambience is so good for chilin"

One of my favorite drinks. The taste of the drink is good, at a low price. Very affordable especially for the size of a mall. My favorite is Chocolate milk and Brown sugar milk. There is also a new menu for Dalgona coffee..recommended..

Now try it, because I've never tried it before. why order this one because the color is unique hehe. Honestly, I don't know what Folks Blue is, but when you drink it, it tastes taro, vanilla and a little blueberry all together. For the cheese itself, I think it's inferior to the Folks Blue because it's really sweet, the boba is smaller than what I usually order elsewhere. but it's still delicious when bitten like that hehe. Even though I think it's really sweet, it's still delicious to drink

Is one of the Cheese Tea booths which is quite popular in Malang City. There are various cheese tea drink menus available, and the prices are quite affordable. For purchases, you can take in or through the ojol application. because it is only in the form of a booth / stall, the place to stop is very limited, and the parking space follows the existing stall. There are no toilets or prayer rooms available. Even so, now Cheese Tea is quite popular with young people.
That's a review from me, hope it helps

The coffee served at the coffee shop ""PORTAL COFFEE MALANG"" is coffee from the Malang region. There are Arabica coffees such as Arjuno, Kawi, Parangtedjo, and Selorejo Dau. Then there is Robusta coffee which is a mainstay, namely SRIDONORETNO (DAMPIT) coffee.

Previously, Portal Coffee Malang was one location with The Roots Barbershop Malang. But now the two have moved to separate locations near the old place. The most favorite here is of course the processed coffee. In the afternoon, visitors can also see the coffee roasting process for themselves. There are various types of robusta and arabica coffee beans on offer. Starting from Malang local products and several other areas. Good preparations include palm sugar milk coffee, brewed coffee, V60, afogato, and others. For those who don't like coffee, there are choices of traditional drinks such as wedang uwuh, nasi kencur and turmeric tamarind. Quality and taste to be reckoned with."

Nice place and coffee like home

The nuances of Europe, especially the Netherlands, are immediately felt as soon as you enter a cafe called Huize Jon Coffe. This cafe, which is located on Jl Majapahit, Malang City, carries a different theme compared to other cafes. The combination of Javanese and European nuances, especially the Netherlands, is very strong. From the outside, the modern feel of the building greets every visitor who enters the cafe. Meanwhile, when entering the inside of the cafe, a number of Javanese antique objects are immediately visible. A pair of statues of people dressed in traditional Javanese clothes immediately become an icon on the inside. On the inside of the cafe space, there is also a large Dutch language inscription ""Hartelijk Welkom on Malang. Huize Djon Geschickt Voor Het Maken Van Mooie Uitstapjes Gezzelige Sfeer Voor Iedere Gast"". The writing has the real meaning of Welcome to Malang. Several ancient European and Javanese ornaments, ranging from classic wall clocks made in Germany that are more than 75 years old, televisions, old radios, various leather puppets, classic photographs, to ancient carvings to decorate the sides of the cafe.
The Dutch nuance is also increasingly felt with the inscription in Dutch on the north side of the room, namely 'Uitsmijter Toast'. Uitsmijter itself is the name of a typical Dutch sandwich, while toast means toast.
For the menu offered at Huize Jon, there are various processed coffees such as Original Wine Robusta Coffe, Van Den Berg Wine Robusta Coffe, French Press, Americano, and several other processed coffees. However, for the superior menu at this place, visitors need to try the Dutch special Huize Jon coffe, which is Dutch coffee slightly adjusted to be suitable for consumption by the people of Malang. For menus other than coffee, there are several other choices, such as milkshakes, tea, chocolate, or even ginger. Apart from drinks, this place also provides a food menu, such as french fries, indomie, spring rolls, sandwiches, and several other menu choices written in Dutch, such as Gebakken aardappelen, Vleeskroketjes met mustard, Pannekoek, and various other choices.

Coffee shop that has old skool vibes. serves a variety of coffee and non-coffee drinks and other snacks at affordable prices.

Clean place, pin point map according to location, and there is lodging too.

Huize Jon Wine Coffee is the one you have to try!!
The ""Koffie Met Slagroem"" is also delicious but in my opinion too sweet.

Are you an introverts who likes reading comics while munching good foods? Or are you an extroverts who like spending time playing various board games with you pals? Maybe you are and ambiverts who likes both. This cafe provides a lot of entertainments that may hold you to stay longer. The foods and drinks are relatively cheap and well made. It provides ice cream if available. I declare this place as my gathering venue.

A nice place to hangout and read comic books. Recently renovated to focus more on boardgames, where boardgames are available to rent with apropriate playspace and game master should you need one. Kids friendly boardgames are also available."

I feel SYAHDU ATMOSPHERE when I enjoy poor coarse coffee at the shop which is located in this small alley.

Because the location is inaccessible to vehicles, it's better to park on the side of the main road or in the main square.

Arriving at the location, we can choose whether we want to sit on the available benches & tables, or take a stool (plastic chair) and find our own seat along the aisle.

Even though the price of the black brewed coffee is affordable (Rp. 4,000), the taste is very authentic. The coffee tastes thick, according to my taste.

If you don't like regular brewed coffee, Kauman also provides a variety of coffee flavors that are more modern and suitable for today's youth."

The good networking place

Nice place

located on the 2nd floor of the tempe spiritual chip shop. comfortable place. there is parking. the room has a terrace, inside, and there is a meeting room.

the price with the portion and taste is appropriate (even very satisfying at that price). I tried drinking lemon tea and eating spicy basil chicken... the chicken is delicious, for those who like spicy it's just right, the basil is just right. not so fragrant basil. so even if you don't like basil, you can still eat this. for the plating and packaging is also okay.

but because the location is on the 2nd floor, it's not suitable for older people... earlier I slipped on the stairs too because the footing was too small and tight (in my opinion)

Comfortable place to hang out. Located on the top floor of the Spiritual tempeh chip shop with an eye-catching interior"

The place is spacious,  they've got two floors. Unfortunately the indoor non-smoking is not that much. Whereas the smoking area is wider. I might say it is a semi-indoor place, because the smoking room is indoor too.

best place to hangout and get coffee and be comfortable enough to do assignments at. be prepared to struggle over the good spots as they're almost always taken. great place, great food n drinks, 9/10.

No photo for blueberry yogurt drink their have, but it‚Äôs a total bomb for me. Balance taste of yogurt and jelly so refreshing and fun. Foods on display also tempting. One of my concern is their smoking area was dirty when i come there, many ashes on the floor and the table."

+ near rice fields, cool air
+ Standard price
+ there is a play ground, although not too many choices of toys

- service is a bit long
- playground has a separate fee (you will know when paying the bill)
- if it rains, the rest of the rain will take a while to seep. So it's a bit muddy

Definitely can be improved more. Good luck

I visited for lunch and did my work with friends. I experienced a delicious coffee with reasonable price and caring staff. The service was above average. The decor is a stunning with plants theme. I love the atmosphere and ambiance. This place has instagramable spot too. But I thing they need to improve the amount of toilet and the quality of Musholla. Overall this cafe left me an amazing experience and I can't wait to return. wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to hang out with friends.

Shoutout to the good taste of the playlist. Love it!

Beautiful place, with very friendly and helpful staff on duty. For foreigners do spray mosquito repellant first as this place decorated with potted plants and trees, expect to donate a few ounces of your blood.

Price is considered normal for a cafe, give them a try if you are looking for a place to relax and gather photo content.

If you are a coffee addict, I suggest that you order a hand brew, about 4 beans profile for you to choose from. My feedback is that they consider upgrading their espresso machine and grinder for better shots and milk frothing. Not a fair comment maybe cause I have high expectations over espresso base coffee.

A typical cafe with a greeny ambiance. Sad to see several broken tables full of ants. ‚òπÔ∏è

So I suggest you check the Malang promo often so you know the promos for kamsia boba. The price starts from 18k if I'm not mistaken and the cup is really big. It's really wide. I like the chocolate variant the most!!!

The boba drink is delicious, but the seal on the lid is not strong, so one house is broken. :(

it really tastes like this is the best boba anyway. the price is not expensive but super delicious. the best one is the original brown sugar, I've tried other flavors but it's not great.. this is already delicious, the cheese is ok, the sweetness is just right.. instead of buying another brand which is already expensive, 20 thousand and above, it's not worth it, it's better to just buy this

40 thousand buy 2 get 1 free, cheap, the boba is delicious, it's just that the packaging pays more attention because the order via Gofood spilled a bit 2 cups, the original free one is also no less delicious than the taro boba, the sweetness doesn't disappear ""even I just want to finish it, it's a shame, coz the milk tastes fresh and delicious,

Spacious, cozy and has outdoor seatings. But i don't really recommend the food. It tastes just meh. And the beverages need lots of improvement, for that range of price. Haven't tried the snack and not interested in trying one.

The place is decent I would say, I especially loved the interior and outdoor settings. The cafe has transformed the dutch building with blue and white stylings. Quite different what you easily see, for me the architecture stand out when I was driving my motorcycle, piqued my curiosity.
The coffee was fine, not the best. Expecting the manual V60 Japanese brew to be more delicate but it‚Äôs mainly depend on the barista to bring out the taste.

I think this is one of those cafes where you can spend time chatting with a group of friends. Well, it's great for couples too but I think the vibe is not so much suitable for that.
First time at Hindia, we ordered hazelnut latte, some kind of tea and their platter menu. Well, I can't say something special about those three menus.
But I think they need to reconsider putting away those tables placed on the outer side of the outdoor area.

It is a coffee shop and eatery as well. Coffee is basically prepared from a group of selected beans with a coffee machine; so there is nothing special. The menu is rather complete, offering main dishes and snacks. The price is affordable and the location is strategic.

Good beverages. I ordered avocado coffee and it's pretty okay-ish. The food surprisingly came out really good. We ordered kwetiau and banana fritters. The kwetiau was great, meanwhile the banana was okay. The place overall was comfortable, but the service wasn't that great.

STMJ Fresh Milk, which is located in Arjosari, is really good to try

The taste of milk, egg, honey & ginger fits perfectly in the mixture composition

It's clean, fun, the STMJ is good, the main thing is JOS.

Exelent

The location is towards Coban Rondo, strategic and easy to find. During his visit, construction was still being carried out in several spots. The arrangement is pretty good, it's just that sometimes if you're lucky you can smell cow or goat manure. The place of prayer is very sad, not maintained at all. Then the presentation of the food was also very long. Need a lot of improvement to improve the quality.

The place is nice and spacious, it's in a residential area, away from the crowds. But when I arrived, I was with a group of teenagers who played billiards & jenga, it was really noisy, how good is everyone, God, even though the atmosphere was good for small talk.

For all the delicious drinks, try the delicious peach yakult, the coffee isn't bad either. Affordable prices. But the food... It's barely edible :( the tofu looks like it's about to go stale, it's fried in bland flour. It's really sour, it doesn't taste good, it's really messy.

Hopefully the service can be improved, the cashier is too lazy to serve him, we asked questions about the menu, the answers were lazy. It's a shame even though the place is quite okay.

A new cafe that is quite close to home. Perfect for hanging out with friends. On Friday and Saturday there will be singing on the 2nd floor.

So this outlet has a unique and cool model in my opinion, it's more like a Korean theme ""alay like that, the seats use private material and the original is nice to look at but this material if it gets hit by rain it will rot and break
This outlet is staffed by mothers and children, the mother may be in charge of taking care of food such as donuts, waffles etc. while the cute and virgin part of the barista-style drinks, it's a shame the two of them don't wear cool uniforms like outlets"" the other one instead wears short shorts. wkwkwk üòÇ...(tomorrow just wear lingerie so it's badaasss), but they still feel clumsy in the halter eh not flexible when making the order process, the plus point is that the mother-child duo are friendly üôè, one more this outlet is more for take away as a table There are no chairs, there are only chairs for waiting for the order, only 2 birds

Food review: the drinks are manstab abiz semanstab the video is cut tari vs ariel noah... oops üôä, the process of making waffles and donuts takes quite a long time even though I saw them using modern equipment (I can imagine if you get a lot of orders it will definitely be more complicated and the process will be more delayed takes a long time...

That's all... warm greetings from Garangan Elegant

The coffee taste is strong, the quality is also the best. There are donuts & cirengnya also delicious. Keep up the quality & qualityüëåüèª

The coffee is delicious, the side dishes are also delicious, the prices are also reasonable, it's not surprising that talented artists have several times ordered drinks (especially coffee) from Daycinno, the best anyway

I came here on the weekend and it is too crowded... Every table is placed too close from one another, I'm wondering if they correctly follow the pandemic protocol for cafe/restaurant (?) Especially the indoor dine-in area... isn't that too crowded? They should lessen the tables

The food is good
The staffs, especially the security is sooooo friendly and helpful ‚ô°

The pizza and the burger tastes nice. Staffs were kind of friendly. The location is quite nice as well although it's very small. The problem is that it took way too long for the food to come out. That's the thing that gives an illusion of this place being crowded at all times. Not because of they have a lot of customers, but because of slow service.

They claimed ""kopi giras"" as their specialty coffee, which I suspect was a variety of Javanese robusta. Other warkop drinks such as iced coffee and other sweet drinks are also available.

They also served nice condiment: deep fried tempe tepung which tastes good together with the petis. On top of that, the price range is really cheap! They open 24 hours and have a lot of electric terminal in case you need to charge your phone (I believe it's a popular spot to play MOBA with your team because of this).

Cozy interior and extensive menu ranging from Western to Asian food. Fun place to spend the weekend with friends. If you sit indoor, the sound of the coffee machine is quite loud - so maybe it's not really comfortable for working.

Good coffee and good food sometimes always comes with the price. Nice ambience for a friendly hangout, or even a closed meeting. But mind you when you looking for this place you might can't find it right away because there's not quite obvious sign.

I like working here. The ambience is perfect for me to work, and it's not too noisy. The choice of the foods and beverages is quite a lot, so I won't be easily bored even if I work from here everyday. I like their butter rice, and their coffee is quite good. Value of price: $$$

Cafe that has a unique feel, namely full anabul. But don't worry about anabul disturbing you when you hang out :) because they've been isolated in a different room.
The place for the anabul is super clean (no smell), the cafe doesn't smell either, guys, even though there are lots of cats. His employees regularly clean the cage.

The food is delicious with aesthetic arrangement and the drink is nice, comes in fairly cheap price start from IDR 30.000. The service is handy and excellent, the employees is kind. The interior and exterior design is artistic and aesthetic, feels like dining in home with family with cozy atmosphere. This place also has games like guitar, uno, and chess. This place also has free WiFi. Suitable for study and work, or if you just want to eat alone in cozy atmosphere. Gotta recommended this place.

Its located on a remote location, but okay

To be honest i didn't know (or probably never know) if i didn't accidently passed this cafe on my way back home. This cafe is pretty decent for  some remote area/place, it has some cozzy sensation thatvyou usually find on high end cafe on Jakarta or its surrounding. Overall this place have all you need for a stereotype cafe.

The only minus that i'm aware of is the location and place. The first, as i already mentioned it's located on a remote area so it will be hard to find for ordinary people. The second one, although just because someplace located on a remote area doesn't mean the place is definitely small and doesn't have enough parking lot, but on this occasion its is. It will be very difficult if you planned to go into this cafe with a car, because there is no dedicated parking lot for car and even if you planned to go with motorcycle, make sure you go with an single motorcycle if you want park on this cafe.

But after all, this place is overally good if you put aside the location an vehicle problem and just i said before, this place have all you need for a stereotype cafe.

A nice hidden place for a cup of coffee and a cozy atmosphere. Great wifi, great ambience, pretty good coffee but a lack access for parking especially if you ride a car. It opens from 10 AM in the morning."

I ordered mie goreng and tea., the tea taste really good. Mie goreng was abit salty., next time should try the coffee. I went there before christmas, they put nice christmas ornaments

The atmosphere there is good.
But the food there is not really satisfying. Honey chicken was either over-fried or fried again and the taste is very ordinary. Not going to pay a cafe price for that kind of food quality.
There heritage noodles also taste just like mie goreng from any other street food stores. Sorry to say, taste and potion are better in those food stores.
So, not very recommend to eat there.
However, the coffee is ok.

If you're a morning person, this place may suit your appetite looking for new ideas. It has an Instagrammable view at every corner. There are variety of coffee and food menu when you're looking forward of a big breakfast. The price is in middle range. It's not too expensive nor too cheap as well.

The atmosphere is really good.. it is recommended to wear a jacket upstairs the air is free so it feels cold..
The food and drinks are delicious, all of them are good... don't be disappointed

Not enough to make you feel at home.. uno blocks / uno cards

Wafa Coffee n' Space, the place is cute, clean with white and white nuances. Apart from looking cute and clean with the white tones on the building, Wafa for some reason, in my view, is just as homey as it is on the 1st floor. That doesn't mean the 2nd floor isn't comfortable. Judging from the arrangement of furniture and decorative ornaments, Wafa seems to have been designed for those of you who want to get together while being productive, but also comfortable for those of you who like to drink coffee alone, really comfortable.

Talking about the menu, you will find a lot of mixed drink menus, both cold milk coffee variants and non-coffee variants created by Wafa. Don't forget, there are also heavy meals and snacks, you know. For heavy meals, there are rice bowls with several flavors, which, to be honest, tastes good to me, pol mesio. I haven't tried it in a long time, and for snacks, you can guess for yourself.
For the price, Wafa prices its drinks and food at around 15 thousand to 25 thousand, if I'm not mistaken.

The service is good, it's just that Wafa currently seems to be hampered by the number of human resources, so sometimes you have to wait a little longer for your order to arrive.
But apparently that's a plus point, you know. So you can chat first with your friends or something like that.

Actually Wafa has a really nice atmosphere. It's good for being alone, it's good for being together, but it's a shame that Wafa's location is on the side of a road which is quite busy with driving activity so it's sometimes a bit noisy.
But it's okay, it's called the way of many people.

That's about it, the rest you can stop by directly at Wafa. I hope you all agree with the place, menu, and service provided by Wafa. Xalaam!!

Uwuuw for coffee... The price is right, the taste is delicious, it's great...

Overall, it was a pleasant experience dining out here. We orderes several dishes: Chicken Nanban, Meatball something and Matcha Kitkat Cake. For the drinks, we had Cappucino Caramel Crumble and Buttercookies Tea.
The foods taste great. I could tolerate the crunchiness of the chicken katsu, while the sauce completes it really well. It's savory and creamy.
The Meatball also kinda startled us because they use some kinda strawberry sauce. It's new for us. Surprisingly, its sourness and sweetness don't overpower the savory taste of the meatball and mashed potato.
For the dessert, I picked the matcha cake. I could really taste the matcha flavor out of it while its not being too sweet. I love it.
I'd probably revisit the place to try another cake on the selections.

Katamichi is 1 of the best and comfiest cafe in town. It's decoration is awesome and cute. Food and baverage here is delicious, you gonna find them cute and lovely as well. Recommend this place for hang out with your friend or do your work. Their tea and cake is super recommended. You also gonna find some cute stuff there!
Everything will be perfect if the place have Japanese song on their Playlist, so the ambience is truly Japanese.

The mille crepes are delicious and fulfilling. The coffee is strong and good."

The place for this restaurant is fun, and unique. Indeed, the location is not on the edge of the highway. It's located in an alley, go to the right, before kak ros' restaurant. Go about 20 meters inside. What is unique again, next to this restaurant is a rice field. So it looks cool. If it's busy, it's usually after sunset, until the early hours of the morning#"

Now try it, because I've never tried it before. why order this one because the color is unique hehe. Honestly, I don't know what Folks Blue is, but when you drink it, it tastes taro, vanilla and a little blueberry all together. For the cheese itself, I think it's inferior to the Folks Blue because it's really sweet, the boba is smaller than what I usually order elsewhere. but it's still delicious when bitten like that hehe. Even though I think it's really sweet, it's still delicious to drink

Is one of the Cheese Tea booths which is quite popular in Malang City. There are various cheese tea drink menus available, and the prices are quite affordable. For purchases, you can take in or through the ojol application. because it is only in the form of a booth / stall, the place to stop is very limited, and the parking space follows the existing stall. There are no toilets or prayer rooms available. Even so, now Cheese Tea is quite popular with young people.
That's a review from me, hope it helps

Really recommend, it feels like the location is also strategic after the macaroni ngehe

As a non coffee lover. The butter coffee is not bitter and tasted good. The fried noodle is decent. A bit too sweet for my preferences. Crowded and smoking area but overall good

Best kopitiam in malang town so far
I have tried some kind of places in malang, and i found that this place is the best overall
I like the butter coffee, not to sweet not to strong
I like the kaya butter toast too. It is a perfect combination.
I ordered the other food too, and all was good. The price is really affordable.
But, there is not enough chair and table. You have to queue for about 10-20 minutes. N.b i came at 10 am
Definitely will come back next time

oldschool kopitiam that everyone would love! it's located near train station, so we made a short visit to takeaway some food to be enjoyed in train. overall it tasted good with affordable price

If you like retro places, you must try this coffee shop. The vibes of this place is like 80s Singaporean coffee shops, who served Coffee, Milk Tea, Bread, and Half-boiled Egg. The coffees are great, their must try are the Butter Coffee and Coffee with Evaporated Milk. But if you like the classic, their Classic Black Coffee is a bomb. Also the Kaya Butter Bread! Sweetness from the Kaya jam and the saltiness of the butter mixed very well, it's delicious! Their menu is not too much, just a bit snacks like Cireng, Mendoan and Ngo Hiong (this one, very recommended!!), also the main course, like Fried Bakmee (a bit too sweet for me, but still delish!) and Soup Bakmee. Also the ambience, it's very cozy and calm, you'll want to spend hours here if you love the old city vibes. Definitely gonna come back if I visit Malang again!"

Still better for me, since they have excellent staff and their coffee is superb!

After exploring many coffee shops, I found one coffee shop which I think is really worth it for students like us to visit üòÄ.  Nakoa cafe Bondowoso is one of my favorite hangout cafes, it seems I have visited this cafe countless times.  The reason why Nakoa is my favorite cafe is that most of the people who come here are students doing their assignments, so it makes the atmosphere of the cafe calm and not chaotic.  The people at Nakoa also don't care about visitors, so I think Nakoa is really good for me time.  My favorite menu here is the matcha latte üíö.  Apart from the matcha latte, the drinks here are also delicious.  The price is also standard, which is under 25,000.  Apart from selling drinks, here they also sell some delicious food, moreover, the donuts are really delicious and cheap üòÉ.  For those of you who like to do assignments alone, you can really try this Nakoa cafe.

The place so comfy for works both indoor and outdoor, the coffee is great too. WiFi so fast, the staff so friendly, i have a good experience at Nakoa Cafe, just need some improvement to make the toilet clean. Overall is good, i'll come again to Nakoa Cafe. Waiting for the new menu for filling my tummy.

This is a special place for co-working which makes it also a great coffee shop. Italian espresso machine Simonelli makes nice coffees and you feel like being in a sort of modern museum. Really outstanding design....well done!

I think the doughnut is a normal doughnut. It has no speciality, except the price, 9k ü§≠

Are you an introverts who likes reading comics while munching good foods? Or are you an extroverts who like spending time playing various board games with you pals?

The place is hidden in a small road and unexpected üòä I found it by chance but it was actually a nice surprise. I like the setting especially the veranda outside. A free setting makes the place look bigger and relaxing atmosphere is obvious here.
The drinks are good and the sushi is ok.
Lots of parking place for motorcycles but the cars have  to park on the side road next to it. Worth a try üòäüòä

Affordable good food with big portions, better sit outside under the shade because the indoor building is too hot even if all aircons were turned on. The service from the waiter/waitress was good, but not for the cashier. The cashier lady was unfriendly and not very welcoming towards me & my friends, she handled our order lazily like she didn't want to be there.

Love the ambiance. It's located in a quiet neighbourhood. Vast parking area. Very bright, the place will put you in a good mood once your glance at it. Really love the outdoor area. Best time to come here I think is around 3-5p.m. Coupled with Malang fresh air. Definitely a place for a fun gathering with friends. Food was alright. We ordered School Dosirak and Jjajangmyeon, with Itaewon (ReVe drink) and Hongdae (milk w/ salted caramel). Itaewon drink could be better. Hongdae was tasty. The staffs were very friendly and helpful.

Love the atmosphere here. For those who want to feel the Korean vibe and who like K-Pop, it's really suitable here. The parking lot is quite wide and next to Sejenak Coffee.
The interior design looks simple from the outside, as soon as you enter, you immediately feel the Korean vibes because of the Korean decorations and music being played. Aesthetic in every corner.
There are quite a lot of indoor and outdoor places. In the indoor area, there is a really good photobox. In the outdoor area there is a pojangmacha selling street food.
The menu options vary, from snacks to heavy meals. There is a grill package menu, ramyeon and other menus such as mandu, kimbab and many more. For drinks, there are quite a few choices. There is also a showcase filled with bottled and canned drinks. Prices range is 23 thousand - 55 thousand rupiahs. Suitable for lunch or dinner. Or hanging out, snacking, and enjoying the vibes is also okay. If you're expecting food in k-drama, you'll find it here.

The white nuance, which is also obtained from the fence, some of the furniture, and the door and window frames, makes Bataputi Coffee House a clean and attractive photo backdrop. Coupled with a beautiful cafe environment, surrounded by trees and ornamental plants from the outside to the inside, Bataputi Coffee House has remained as a favorite cafe in Malang since its establishment in 2015.

Many potential photo backgrounds at Bataputi Coffee House. The most favorite is the outer part of the cafe, which has white rattan tables and chairs. We can take photos with 3 backgrounds at once: a wooden gazebo which is part of the smoking area, the Bango River and the trees on its banks that divide Araya Housing, and the magnificent Araya Bridge. Now the chandelier that adorns the Araya Bridge lights up brightly before night falls. Not only does it add to the coolness of your photo background, but it also makes the night atmosphere warm and romantic!

Just open every day at 3 pm, on weekends Bataputi Coffee House starts to get busy at 5 pm. Visitors generally aim to sit in the gazebo and non-smoking rooms that are air-conditioned and have sofas. Besides being a fun place, the food and drinks offered by Bataputi Coffee House are affordable. We tasted two coffee drinks recommended by the friendly cafe staff, namely avocado coffee and the other which is only available on weekends, es kopi susu tempo doeloe.

The coffee in avocado coffee is still quite dominant even though it is served with vanilla ice cream. So if you like light coffee, the creamy tempo doeloe iced coffee is more suitable. Moreover, the special thing is that this milk coffee ice is served with market snacks, the types of which depend on availability.

Heavy meals range from pizza, burgers, to rice, pasta and noodle based ones. Afternoon is the right time for snacking, so we ordered two snacks that cost around tens of thousands of rupiah: fried bananas, gula Jawa and onion rings. The onion rings are crunchy and delicious to eat warmly. However, you must order the Javanese sugar fried banana, which is not sprinkled with meises and cheese as usual, but in a traditional style with a sprinkling of brown sugar and young coconut.

One of the best cafes in Malang to relax, unwind, and be close to the nature. It's really difficult finding a caf√© that has a good view and not just fake plants inside the building for pure decorative purpose. Bataputi has a wide selection of food & beverages, and in my experience, they all taste good.

Prices are reasonable, staffs are helpful. Wifi could be improved a little bit, especially in the outdoor area. But all in all, a perfect choice for a 'me time' or to hang out with friends and family.

To be honest I was a bit unsure to come to this place until last month. It was driven by the fact that lots of eatery and coffee house were open offering merely their good look.
Bataputi, however, indeed has good look especially for its interior and location by the river bank,and offers great food. I find the basic menu, such as fried rice, satisfactory. The fresh ingredients and combination of spices bring the savor everyone is looking for. Should one need to indulge in some comfort food accompanied by friendly coffee while enjoying afternoon breeze, Bataputi is the one to visit. The best time to be here is from 3-6 p.m.
The prices might be higher than average around Malang but it worth the money spending for.

Cozy place to hangout, meet up with friends. Banyak pilihan kids friendly

Place was okay, View was good. But for beverages, they can do better."

Give Kopituju a visit and you will see how this place stands out among the rest of the buildings. Going inside, the ambiance is humble but welcoming. Coffee was simply satisfying, one of the best in town. In general, this cafe feels like an oasis in the hustle and bustle of Malang, where you can escape for a caffeine fix.

Best coffee in Malang (in my opinion), and their burnt basque cheese cake, is the best I have ever tried.

Coffee taste decent. Too bad they have a very limited options for food. But still a good option if you want to escape the city loud noise.

Lovely and quiet place. The staffs are friendly, the price is affordable. You should try their Es Rempah.

They make you feel's like home!  Quite place for escape from crowd for a moment.  They also will serve you with a nice coffee,  sweet smile and with happiness.

The salted egg chicken was nice
But the garlic butter something was too much garlic.. make the taste weird

Many times order here from go food and grab food .. they never read the note!!!!!!!! I asked for well cook egg!!! And sometimes its comes without cutlery etc

They have a huge portion for a rice box. The garlic butter chicken boxy is plain for me and the garlic is too much on the chicken. The thai tea is also too many ices, so the flavor is plain. After all, they have nice packaging.

Small, quiet yet comfy place with tasty meals & drinks. Keep your work stay at the office while you take your lunch time here. And by the way, dont forget to bring on your friends too :)

For a box meal, the portion is huge, just like regular meal. Have some choices of sauce, from classic salted egg until sambal matah sauce. The place itself is cozy, with black and modern-themed open room.

First thought in choosing this place was because it has a photobox which allow us to make memories while we were there. This cafe serves as usual cafe: good ambience, nice for hang out. You can stay as long as you can. The place is clean and super huge. Do not worry for not getting an empty seat. However, taste wise and food presentation-wise this cafe offer ordinary experience. Food weren‚Äôt top notch, as wel as the beverages. Good place for hang out yes, good place for eating? Think again.

great place to hang out, eat and drink with friends. Cozy and clean.Above average than other hangout places in the city of Malang, the price offered is still affordable ranging from Rp. 20,000 to Rp. 45,000 depending on the food you choose.there are indoor and outdoor places, complete with prayer rooms.

came here because one of my friend suggested to try this place. it was good. the ambience was the typical coffee shop with bustling sounds of people hanging out with their friends or clacking sounds of people working from the cafe. the food came out good, but not that tasty. the food was a bit expensive, if I must say.

AADK is a high class concept! One of the best cafe where keeps an indoor and outdoor area. The ambience of the first floor is very suitable to create a warm friendship, sharing love and laugh. There's a photobox there and every corner is so instagramable. The atmosphere of the second floor is really appropriate to engage communication and find solution. There's a space to be a workplace and having intense conversation. The service is good, the menu is also unquestionable, and the price is normal and affordable.

I love with the interior, chill and calm.. My fav tea is the one with lychee and rose flowers. Unfortunately the menu variations is not much..but if you wanna try Korean food, Seoul Scent just right next to this cafe..

Went there when they have ‚ÄúSarapan Gratis‚Äù promo and everything was soooo good üòç

Hidden gem that are not too busy, with carefully crafted menus.

Nice place, aesthetic in all parts indoor & outdoor, for drink I like sigurih the most. When I went there, it was cloudy and then after a while it started to rain. While the indoor area is not that wide, so there are some visitors who take shelter outside, I suggest it would be even better if the indoor area was expanded.

Also, when I ordered a cheese cake, the cashier said it was available, so I paid for it, but after a while she said it was sold out. Finally I ordered another cake and the cashier said the change would be given to me later but she didn't give it to me until I finally asked for it myself as I was planning to leave.

So please improve the service again, and hopefully it will get even better on my next visit, but overall this is a great place üòÖüåø‚òï

Good coffee at populist prices, yes, this is the place,,
Even though the price is cheap, the taste is still good (which I drink AMERICANO and ES KOPI SUSU). According to my tongue, the AMERICANO is similar to the famous cafes in Malang. The coffee is really strong, the coffee dose is just right, not too much water.
The seats are right in front of visitors, so you can immediately see the coffee brewing process and talk directly with the barista.

Also, this place is spacious, there are indoor and outdoor space and not so crowded, just perfect! Price range from 17k to 30k something. The staff is friendly too, much love‚ú®Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Plus point for their nice, quiet and cozy ambience. But not a fan for what they serve. Coffee taste not so good, and their mashed potato is bland with no creamy taste at all. Or maybe I just pick the wrong dish? Improve your dishes and drink, and maybe I'll consider another visit.

Will definitely be my favourite coffee shop in Malang. The coffee is superb! Try pour over V60 Gayo wine beans. Sooo light and clear. And surprisingly, it's not really expensive for such a fragrant and tasty coffee. The place? So much greeny and peaceful. It's got a concept a vintage house. A house during Dutch colonization.

Service was excellent, very friendly staffs. Restroom was okay, but can be improved. Inside there was a vape store as well, but in a glass-separated room.

I was most impressed by their Furikake Karaage. To me, it tastes perfect--since I prefer sweet dish. I think it was worth the money. Meanwhile, their cafe latte is okay. Though I prefer another coffee shop's latte, Labore's is just fine. Lastly, I kinda like the vibe here with all black walls and furniture and it was not too crowded when I first visited the place. Overall, I'd definitely come back.

-Tea Bar Leaves-

Bored with hanging out at the coffee shop, so you can shift to the tea shop. The tea here is not just any tea. The taste is very unique, it is made directly so it is guaranteed to taste fresh and distinctive. You can really request if you want sweet or sour. The price is also very affordable, from 15-25 depending on the taste variant. The stock is also sometimes empty, yes, because the seller is deliberately possible so that the original taste doesn't disappear and disappoints.

For me, who is enjoying tea for the first time, it's delicious, isn't it? Friendly and polite service. Parking is good for motorbikes. There are indoor and outdoor. Very close to the highway. Comfortable seating both inside and out. Toilets are also clean. It's cool to just sit and enjoy tea alone or with friends and family.

Thirst savior drink with various variants of processed tea and fruit drinks.

In my opinion, the most recommended are Jasmine Hibiscus and their Mogu-Mogu Tea. So refreshing!

Apart from drinks, there is now a food menu and side dishes such as chicken katsu, corn dogs and home made brownies.

Often pass by but this is the first time stopping by and finally regretting why I didn't stop by yesterday

You can get to this place because you got lost following the gmaps, so stop by. As for the place, it's quite easy to reach, the weather is cool, the cafe design is okay.
But apologize in advance, my honest review of the price is not suitable for students. The menu was less varied and I was confused about choosing a menu because my stomach didn't go well with coffee and chocolate. As a result, I ordered chocolate ice & baso aci. Baso aci at a price of 20 thousand that I ordered was too expensive because it wasn't worth the filling. But the chocolate ice is pretty good.
It is hoped that my review can be used as a consideration for evaluating this cafe so that in the future it can grow & be even better. Success alwaysüëåüèª

All about rice. You must try it for culinary lovers, especially in Malang. Many variants of Snack and rice bowl are on the menu.

Just a suggestion, maybe the cooking can be accelerated. Because I often get orders here, the cooking takes a long time. And for drinks, it's better to use a sealer, even if you don't have a sealer, it's better to just wrap it in plastic. Because if you use a cup, it will spill, even if the cup is wrapped in a plastic strap, it still spills a lot.

the place is delicious, isn't it too crowded either, then I ordered hot taro last night and the taste isn't too sweet either, it's just right on my tongue because sometimes it's too sweet, right, after that my friend who ordered matcha sm ate the rice + egg. the price is also quite worth it, you can try it, but if you bring a car, it's a bit difficult to park ü§£ so I suggest you just bring a motorbike, good service too, friendly service

The best copy in the Plaosan universe so far. The coffee menu is delicious, you can compete with other coffees. The taste is good, the taste of the coffee extract and not too sweet. I've never tried this food, but they say it's recommended. For the menus, the prices are affordable, you know, not up to 20 thousand. The atmosphere of the place is also warm and good, the baristas are santuy pol wes. The place is suitable for just coffee or it can really be for meetings. Overall, you should try this copy :)

Baristas are welcome, Espresso is strong, coffee maker is complete & modern, 5G signal is worth it for gaming

Friendly baristas, everyone likes the menu. If you like coffee, it's definitely suitable because the taste of the coffee is quite strong. Full music and fast service"

Klojen, Kota Malang, Jawa Timur 65116, Indonesia","cafe, store, restaurant, point_of_interest, food, establishment",4.5,77,,"The location is easy to find, just several meters from the gate of Ijen Nirwana Residence. Well, this place is not so spacious though. It's rather small for a cafe located downtown. But as long as you come at the right hours where the crowd is considerably minimum, then you will get a nice ambience instead. Meanwhile, as usual, I tried their latte. It was good enough. But their platter which consists of fried broccoli, kind of mushroom, potatl wedges and fried tofu was incredible. It's tasty and the sauce has some kind of unique sweet taste.

Visit this place after it got promoted by a local IG food reviewer. Nothing's special about this coffeeshop. Price are a bit expensive for that size of coffee. Dish needs forever to be served. Can't find a non-smoking table, unless those one outside.

I like the ambience, the drinks are great. I ordered strawberry creamy and ice coffee mantra. The strawberry creamy is basically like strawberry milk with the exact sweetness based on my likes. The ice coffee mantra, which is specialty in this cafe, but I think isn't special because the taste is like basic ice coffee milk *imo*.
The place is great for hang out with your friends, but not really great for those of you who want to be alone, because it's pretty crowded.

Location: 5/5 (easy to find.)
Place: 3/5 (great interior, I like the wall painting and painting in a frame, very creative. But I think, the cafe should put more ventilation, because sometimes customers are smoke in the indoor room. I found it pretty stuffy for indoor room)
Price: 4/5 (affordable prices according to the quality of the food)

Aesthetic place with limited menu to choose. Food is fair-priced considering the quantity and taste. Air circulation is problematic if you sit inside in a humid, hot weather and smoking area is basically everywhere. Waiter, cook, and barista are all very welcoming. Worth the visit with group of friends, but not intimate place for couples.

Price is considered normal for a cafe, give them a try if you are looking for a place to relax and gather photo content.

If you are a coffee addict, I suggest that you order a hand brew, about 4 beans profile for you to choose from. My feedback is that they consider upgrading their espresso machine and grinder for better shots and milk frothing. Not a fair comment maybe cause I have high expectations over espresso base coffee.

They keep an eclectic mix of Indonesian tunes playing in the background.  We ordered the pisang goreng, brownie, green tea, water, and a Cold White Haze.  The pisang goreng is a delicious, sweet pastry type dish.  The green tea was delicious, and the Cold White Haze cold brew was a refreshing chocolate flavored cold coffee.

The location is quite strategic, because it's in a dormitory environment, so at least there are many visitors from the dormitory environment.
Besides that, the location is on the road that accesses the UNITRI campus.

The food are good.  Lil bit overprice. There are 2 different variant of menu .. traditional and also western.beer, coffe, steak, salad etc. Tasty but my Poutin is too much salt and pepper. Great peeformance so far.

Honestly this place has a very nice building and interiors are very nice. But the service itself is not even decent. I ordered asem asem bola daging, the food looks very nice and i was really craving for this, but one thing was that i couldn‚Äôt eat spicy food for today for particular reason. When i ordered the food, ive asked the waiter TWICE wether the food was spicy or not, and the waiter has confirmed, that it‚Äôs not spicy, yes he confirmed it twice and i heard it very clearly about every single word that he said that the food ISNT SPICY, i believed it and gave it a chance. I have placed all my hopes for this food but when the food came, it came with tons of chili, it wasn‚Äôt even 5 or 10, it was more than 10. I tried to separate the chili from the soup but it didn‚Äôt do anything, this made me very dissatisfied. When the waiter had said that this asem asem wasn‚Äôt spicy AT ALL, and turns out it was very VERY spicy. The steak was also raw, and the sauce taste was normal, i wont even say its worth for my money. This restaurant is disappointing."

First time ordering here online, the food is really good. The salted egg chicken rice box is a winner, especially if you eat it when it's warm.

But yesterday when I ordered manual brew v60, the taste of the coffee was still lacking in my opinion, either because the coffee beans were not fresh, or something else that I didn't know.

Wafa Coffee n' Space, the place is cute, clean with white and white nuances. Apart from looking cute and clean with the white tones on the building, Wafa for some reason, in my view, is just as homey as it is on the 1st floor. That doesn't mean the 2nd floor isn't comfortable. Judging from the arrangement of furniture and decorative ornaments, Wafa seems to have been designed for those of you who want to get together while being productive, but also comfortable for those of you who like to drink coffee alone, really comfortable.

Talking about the menu, you will find a lot of mixed drink menus, both cold milk coffee variants and non-coffee variants created by Wafa. Don't forget, there are also heavy meals and snacks, you know. For heavy meals, there are rice bowls with several flavors, which, to be honest, tastes good to me, pol mesio. I haven't tried it in a long time, and for snacks, you can guess for yourself.
For the price, Wafa prices its drinks and food at around 15 thousand to 25 thousand, if I'm not mistaken.

The service is good, it's just that Wafa currently seems to be hampered by the number of human resources, so sometimes you have to wait a little longer for your order to arrive.
But apparently that's a plus point, you know. So you can chat first with your friends or something like that.

Actually Wafa has a really nice atmosphere. It's good for being alone, it's good for being together, but it's a shame that Wafa's location is on the side of a road which is quite busy with driving activity so it's sometimes a bit noisy.
But it's okay, it's called the way of many people.

That's about it, the rest you can stop by directly at Wafa. I hope you all agree with the place, menu, and service provided by Wafa. Xalaam!!

Uwuuw for coffee... The price is right, the taste is delicious, it's great...

Nakoa cafe Bondowoso is one of my favorite hangout cafes, it seems I have visited this cafe countless times.  The reason why Nakoa is my favorite cafe is that most of the people who come here are students doing their assignments, so it makes the atmosphere of the cafe calm and not chaotic.  The people at Nakoa also don't care about visitors, so I think Nakoa is really good for me time.  My favorite menu here is the matcha latte üíö.  Apart from the matcha latte, the drinks here are also delicious.  The price is also standard, which is under 25,000.

Definitely one of the most unique cafes out there. Many instagrammable spots inside this cafe.

Enjoyed some work time in front of my laptop woth some snacks and drinks. Veru comfortable place.

The foods and drinks are also great. The service from the staff is also veru welcoming and friendly. Definitely will be back.

Cozy place,comfort food,worthy price. Instagramable spot,kids friendly,very recommended üëå

I ordered mie goreng and tea., the tea taste really good. Mie goreng was abit salty., next time should try the coffee. I went there before christmas, they put nice christmas ornaments

The atmosphere there is good.
But the food there is not really satisfying. Honey chicken was either over-fried or fried again and the taste is very ordinary. Not going to pay a cafe price for that kind of food quality.
There heritage noodles also taste just like mie goreng from any other street food stores. Sorry to say, taste and potion are better in those food stores.
So, not very recommend to eat there.
However, the coffee is ok.

If you're a morning person, this place may suit your appetite looking for new ideas. It has an Instagrammable view at every corner. There are variety of coffee and food menu when you're looking forward of a big breakfast. The price is in middle range. It's not too expensive nor too cheap as well. But, the taste of the food is so so for me. The service is okay despite I've had uncomfortable event when the waiter was reluctantly serving us breakfast. Maybe I should come another day to
experience a different service."

Its okay cozy and good food more than price. Recomended

great coffee, they have in-house roastery, and you could buy roasted coffee beans there, and ask them to grind it if you didn't have grinder at home. the only minus for me, is the mushola looks so dirty, and hidden in the 2nd floor, and didn't really well kept & clean

but I do highly recommend the smoking / non-smoking room, for a casual or business meeting. I usually visit Labore after 19.00, their night vibe is also lovely.

Great place to hang out. All menus that we tried was delicious. Not much space in the non-smoking area.

They have tropical-industrial decoration, really like cafes in Canggu, and the coconut tree there really fits with the vibe. They sell mainly non-alcoholic drinks, but they provide cold beers as well. Kinda pricey if it's compared with any other cafe in Malang, but still reasonable. Definitely a must visit if you have an occasion in Malang.

Good vibes cafe. The only constraint is hard to fine car parking here. So my suggestion if you wanted to come here, just bring motorcycle or public transportation.

Very cozy and instagram-able place! I guess mostly 'Kera ngalam' (Malang's youth people) knowed this place, because i got the recommendation from my friend in Malang.

The place are very big and wide. Its near from UMM (Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang) campus. There's outdoor&indoor suite room. For you who loves nature vibes, the outside suite room is really high recommended to chosen.

For the menu, there are a lot of food and beverages popular menu, such as 'Pisang Gigit', 'Roti Bakar', 'Hot Chocolate', 'Coffe beer'. I like the 'Kapiten Coffe Beer', you can drunk that beverages safety because its 0% alcohol even using beer as the mixed beverages with coffe. The taste is delicious also.

Vapestore top üî•

Good

Good place

It was the first time I went to a vape store in Malang, and my expression was WOW WOW WOW. Why? According to me:

1. The location factor, it's very comfortable here, the room is air-conditioned, the atmosphere is relaxed, the arrangement of the place is minimalist and neat so that it is ""eye-catching"" with the products being sold, but there are still minuses starting from the lack of seats so that it is less supportive for a place to hang out and share knowledge after buying a product or just sharing with the owner.

2. Service factor, TOP MARKOTOP, the owner is super friendly to me who is illiterate in ""vaping"", he still gives knowledge in a fun and easy to understand way, so I understand and am satisfied with the questions I asked the store owner, he too Patiently answering my questions, even though I actually understand a little.

3. Product factors and product prices, in this case I am still okay with the products being sold and offered to me, because the prices and products here are almost all vape stores selling what this shop sells, I haven't found any rare products being sold here or maybe I don't know which products are rare or not.

Conclusion:
I give this shop a score of 95 out of 100 because it's not from the location and product factors, but from the friendly and ""friendly"" service, I feel like I'm talking to my own friends

Suggestions and critics:
To store owners;
Please extend your store's opening hours so that customers who don't have time in the morning or afternoon can visit your store at any time.
Please add seats for customers so they can linger, the goal is to feel comfortable and be able to share knowledge with fellow vape users and with you as a shop owner.
If you have added a ""hanging out"" facility, don't forget to make it complete, provide soft drinks for your customers to buy, so that it will be more comfortable and crowded with customers.

That's all from me, thank you for your service

You haven't been to Malang if you haven't been to IKMC Malang. Strategic place because it is in the heart of Malang. Highly recommended for local and foreign guests.

The UKM/IKM center in Malang Regency is the most suitable place to look for quality products produced by local wisdom of Malang Raya...its strategic location near the Alon-Alon Malang city, personal experience of its products which are always sought after by product hunters from other regions because of their products with real character. different from the results of local products from other regions even though with the same type of product...let's prove it by visiting it.."

Beli menu kopi di pagi hari free donat. Must try sarsaparila, caramel machiato, enoki crispy.

Honestly their interior is a bit off. Their menus are okay but please, if you're in a small indoor place don't put your music volume too loud! Your customers will not get comfy and ended up not buying more of your menus!

the place is comfy. a good place for u, instagram-slave haha. pricey, at least for me. love the toilet. clean. the 2nd floor is to die for. they provide tables with sofas and live music on the 2nd floor. u can also see the night street through the balcony. the food is good. definitely a place for u to hang out

My personal favorite coffee shop in Malang.
The food and drinks I‚Äôve ordered always taste right on my buds.

I fell in love with the place thanks to the sofas area on the 2nd floor. They look a lot like a family restaurant in the west lol! It‚Äôs cute and private. The WiFi is fast and consistent, so you definitely can study, work, or just enjoy your netflix comfortably. I always visited the place in the morning till afternoon so far, and it‚Äôs never been too crowded. Perhaps because I haven‚Äôt stop by at its peak hour.

They accept ovo as well which is good.

It's a two-story cafe so the place is quite spacious. The theme for the 1st and 2nd floor is different, the 1st floor interior looks like a common yet comfy interior you'd find in any typical cafe. The 2nd floor looks like a family dinner place, the other section looks like casual-colorful themed, the terrace is woody-themed [?]

Their drink tastes alright and the pricing is no different than other caf√©s (around IDR 20K and up). We bought a toast and mozzarella stick, hmm... the taste and presentation can be improved.

There's a lot of seating arranged for small to large group. We went there around 8 PM and sat on the 2nd floor terrace. I tell you it's not the best place to enjoy the night. Although the cafe itself located in a strategic place with good parking space, the road is way too busy and noisy for you to hold a proper conversation without raising your voice. Even though the 1st floor music sounds a bit louder, I suppose it's better that way because you'd hear less noise from the busy road."

Good coffee at populist prices, yes, this is the place,,
Even though the price is cheap, the taste is still good (which I drink AMERICANO and ES KOPI SUSU). According to my tongue, the AMERICANO is similar to the famous cafes in Malang. The coffee is really strong, the coffee dose is just right, not too much water.
The seats are right in front of visitors, so you can immediately see the coffee brewing process and talk directly with the barista.

Very cozy coffee shop. The architecture of the room is also very nice. Coupled with room knick-knacks. Very good and amazing. The dishes served are also varied. Ranging from hot to cold there are also. Books are also provided for bookworms. The place is clean. Very good and. Highly recommended for students, colleagues and others.

The place is nice, quiet, good for chatting and not noisy music because my concept is indeed a house made for a shop, but the number of seats is still modest but the menu and drinks are not inferior to other coffee shops. What's more, it's open 24 hours to hang out with your santuy, supported by classic decorations and poetry rhymes that can be the theme of conversation in the midst of gaps

The baristas are nice, sexy and nice to chat with.

Go here if you're looking for a 'hidden gem' cafe that has the soothing and greeny vibes because the music wasn't too loud and it has lots of plants, plus the location is quite distant from the main street.

Oh wow, what a hidden gem I found here in Malang.
I love their concept, it felt like you're visiting your frineds house and hanging out at their garden. The place is not crowded, the vibes are chill and the drinks are great. They provide a great coffee beans here, and the capucino were great! my fave!,
I tried some of their snacks as well, and Inlike the avocados one, surprisingly good, but I think they could only served several sets per day.

would def come back again (hopefully regulary)

Amazing place to do meetings, WFA, and to unwind.

This experience, ordered the Arabica Bajawa Espresso + Cafe Latte
Also the Leuchtfeuer Coffee Costa Rica for the manual brew

Thank you for the experience and best wishes for Roewang Tamoe Coffee

Not exactly sure what is the hype, I know this place from social media and when I was there, sure the coffee is quite good. There are some bread and pastries which seems good.

The one that got my bad side was, since this place is in residential area there were some snack vendors going around the block. When I tried to buy snack from vendor (the coffee shop didnt have this snack and I was still buying their coffee and snacks) they straight up forbid me. I understand there is a ""no food from outside"" rule, but there were no other costomer inside and I always clean up before myself.

Homey coffee shop with retro vibes interior design. Served great coffee. Wanna comeback for sure."

Better take outdoor seating if it wasn't raining and you don't mind seat at smoking area. Coffee's okay, reasonable prices. Don't even think to visit on weekend, unless you only need take-away.

The ambience is not really great for work or study because it's pretty crowded but if you go here only for hanging out, it's quiet good. 7/10 for the americano. 7/10 for the sweet karaage. The place will crowded quickly as soon as it opened. Better reserved a table first before come here

+ Love the color palette of this cafe
+ The bar is so cute
+ Love the Wastafel area
+ Indoor and outdoor
+ Cute concept
- Limited parking lot
- Their food is not quite tasty
- Some furniture finishing is ugly

I came here when this coffe shop just open about a week, so during my visit this cafe always busy. I like their concept about recycling old house into new cafe, without break down the house.
Love their outdoor ceiling, because they use clear ceiling.

A coffee shop that has a unique concept in Malang is different from other coffee shops. It gets an 8/10 for ambiance because it's cute and unique. There are also quite a lot of seats provided, but the place is not too wide for a coffee shop because it is located in a residential area. It looks like this coffee shop is only suitable for chatting with friends and not for doing assignments because the place is quite noisy and crowded, so it's not comfortable if you need a place that's not noisy. For food and drink, I give a rating of 9/10 because it is delicious and unique, and the price is cheap. Various kinds of drinks and food are provided here. From snacks to heavy meals, and in my opinion, all the menus don't fail because they match their appearance with what is on the menu. Service 8.5/10 due to self-service drinks and food delivered by the waitress. Besides that, for those of you who like to take pictures here, a photobox is provided. for which, of course a separate fee is charged.

I do like this cafe! Small, but so comfort! I can say that I will be enjoy and no boring to spend a half day here! The food and drinks are so good!

And surprisingly, it's not really expensive for such a fragrant and tasty coffee. The place? So much greeny and peaceful. It's got a concept a vintage house. A house during Dutch colonization. I feel like in my grandma's house in the village.

The second time we comeback here‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è the pancakes was seduced me.
Price really ok for the good pancakes.. 15k for the single basic pancakeüòç
And caramel macchiato üòçüòçüòç pasta was ok. Ricebowl also still worth it..
Cozy place to chill maybe work little bit chit chat.. maybe little bit chill music make this place more cozyü§ó
but one thing little bit bothering me that I had to sit next to active smokers people who smoke all the time even I told him that is bother us.
Cause is writen no where in this room! So disrespecful and 0 tolerant.

Great for outdoor quick photoshoot.
There was an outdoor picnic set up for groups, interesting.

I only go there once, and i think i will think twice to go there again. I appreciate their concept of making a cafe with a nice scenery in the evening. They have some chairs and tables in the yard. So you can have chit chat either with your friends or your boyfriend/girlfriend. I like one of the menu, banana nugget. However, the serious point is that i think the menu are overprice for some ppl like me. Also, they dont offer various menu to be selected.

Cant take a proper picture yet rest assured it was a nice place to hang out. However, i hope that there are more food options in the menu.

Great place to hangout with friends and family. A lil bit cold at night because it's semi outdoor place, don't forget to bring your jacket or warm suit. Super cozy atmosphere!

Good place to chill and spend time with companies or by yourself.
All drinks and snacks are highly recomended with pocket friendly price.
Nice hospitality and cool peacefull ambience.
Also provided clean restrooms and spacious musholla, a huge plus point for this cafe.

Its located on a remote location, but okay

To be honest i didn't know (or probably never know) if i didn't accidently passed this cafe on my way back home. This cafe is pretty decent for  some remote area/place, it has some cozzy sensation thatvyou usually find on high end cafe on Jakarta or its surrounding. Overall this place have all you need for a stereotype cafe.

The only minus that i'm aware of is the location and place. The first, as i already mentioned it's located on a remote area so it will be hard to find for ordinary people. The second one, although just because someplace located on a remote area doesn't mean the place is definitely small and doesn't have enough parking lot, but on this occasion its is. It will be very difficult if you planned to go into this cafe with a car, because there is no dedicated parking lot for car and even if you planned to go with motorcycle, make sure you go with an single motorcycle if you want park on this cafe.

But after all, this place is overally good if you put aside the location an vehicle problem and just i said before, this place have all you need for a stereotype cafe.

A nice hidden place for a cup of coffee and a cozy atmosphere. Great wifi, great ambience, pretty good coffee but a lack access for parking especially if you ride a car. It opens from 10 AM in the morning."

Well, it provides everything you need for a proper steady and quiet environment for a zoom meeting. The ambiance is not fancy but suprisingly comforting for online meetings purposes. Affordable standard menu range from basic cappucino to their signature drink.

It is very basic but yet only few places in town who offer this kind of services.

Good place for casual meet, Good food with good price but the the coffee that I ordered was not really good. A little bit long bitter taste eventhough the beans should be good

Good coffee good place

Had a nice time coming here 2 times. Menu is averaged pricing (between 20rb to 40rb), mainly serving coffee. Staff are nice and give a friendly vibe. Indoors also has a nice cold spacious room, with a 2nd floor to go to. Outdoors has 2 sides, 1 in the front and the other on the side (which I recommend more). Toilet is also clean and spacious, but keep in mind that there's no toilet paper (as of what I remember).

This is a strategically placed coffee shop on the side of main road and near some of the beautiful places in Malang. Unfortunately their coffee is not very tasty, I would describe their coffee as plain. They offer some tea and chocolate based product which I recommend more than their coffee."

Oase Cafe & Literacy,ChIJBQCWzsP91y0RK2iOIN9clKw,"Jl. Joyo Utomo V, Merjosari, Kec. Lowokwaru, Kota Malang, Jawa Timur 65144, Indonesia","cafe, store, food, point_of_interest, establishment",4.4,619,1,"This cafe is located in Merjosari, to be precise, next to the Merjosari park alley, Malang City. I went to this place because I got together with my friends with scholarships from UIN, UM, and UB to discuss work programs. Here not only serves various kinds of drinks and snacks but also facilitates reading books, visitors who come can spend their time enjoying the meal while reading the books that are neatly arranged on the shelves. In my opinion, the service is pretty good, the taste of the drinks is also pretty good, and the prices are also right from 8 thousand to 20 thousand, it's just that in my opinion the place is not comfortable. The chairs were not neatly arranged after being occupied by other people and the table still had traces of the drink from the previous visitor.

This coffee shop is so well-known arround the students in Malang because this place's included as the most productive coffee shops for discussion and another agendas. It's also commonly called as Gusdurian (a group of people who follow the value of Gus Dur, 4th President of Indonesia) basecamp and also the place for meeting and discussion by another communities tho. There are many books in the first floor, and it's actually has 3 floors. This place is not only sold the coffee, but also tea, milk, hot chocolate and so on.

this place live up to its name. it provides light drinks, coffee, and small snacks. there's a decent public library, means you don't need to worry if you forgot to bring your books. wifi are also available if you're in for some productivity tasks. parking is not shaded and it's on the side of the street directly. may not suitable for dating, but best for group discussion.

EDIT: several days ago I went back and found out if you want to do events here you need to secure mininum purchase of several hundred thousand rupiahs. If you cannot do that, they charge you additional money. But not all the menus are available for us to purchase. Most of them are sold out, but they don't care if we couldn't reach the mark, we still need to pay the money. How could we fulfill their minimum purchase, if we cannot order anything? I lowered my points from 4 to 2. Still a good place, but not recommended for meeting.

I went here for a casual meeting with my friend. They ran out of the snack and meals. I could ordered iced taro only. The price was cheap. I was surprised the photo in the Google maps didn't match the reality. The place was kinda dirty. They might haven't mopped the floor for a really long time. There were thick layer of dust above the books on the shelf. I was having my drink in the rooftop. The rooftop was dirty and kinda dark. There were only one or two light bulbs. The toilet was in the second story, it was really smelly and disgusting. Poorly maintained place.

It's really nice to hang out here actually, especially if you host a discussion event or simply want to meet people and talk upon some issues in depth. For this oase cafe regulars are activists and intellectuals.

I was hosting a discussion event inviting some groups several days ago. The management charges us 210k rupiah for minimum purchase.

What really disappoint me is:
1) they didnt explain that there will be minimum purchase before the d-day
2) I was and am really okay with the minimum purchase, it's small amount of money. I was really sure the crowd will exceed the minimum purchase by ordering several drinks and food. BUT THEY ONLY SERVED DRINKS. THE MEALS ON THEIR MENU WERE NOT AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT YET THEY STILL INSIST FOR US MAKING IT TO MINIMUM PURCHASE
(how could you expect your customer to order a bag of air or a plate of disappointment and inconvenient and swearing never come back there again smh)
3) They even didn't let us start our event until we make it to minimum purchase. I do understand that your company pushed you hard to meet our obligation as client, sir. But please: you should have informed me before the d-day and providing solving to the situation too!
4) I was complaining to the management after the event finished, they told me that IF I DIDNT MAKE THE MINIMUM PURCHASE, I HAD TO GIVE THEM THE SPARE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CHARGED US.
Excuse you, sir, but your company fail to cater us the food you promised to serve. And you expect us to get our money for bags of air and plates of disappointment. Thank you.
5) We did make it to the minimum purchase. Although I had to pay for some orders they served wrong.

It is never about the amount of money for me. It is the hospitality this caf√© fail to provide. I have charged for bigger amounts of money at another caf√© and I was really happy. Definitely will not come back."

Better take outdoor seating if it wasn't raining and you don't mind seat at smoking area. Coffee's okay, reasonable prices. Don't even think to visit on weekend, unless you only need take-away.

The ambience is not really great for work or study because it's pretty crowded but if you go here only for hanging out, it's quiet good. 7/10 for the americano. 7/10 for the sweet karaage. The place will crowded quickly as soon as it opened. Better reserved a table first before come here

+ Love the color palette of this cafe
+ The bar is so cute
+ Love the Wastafel area
+ Indoor and outdoor
+ Cute concept
- Limited parking lot
- Their food is not quite tasty
- Some furniture finishing is ugly

I came here when this coffe shop just open about a week, so during my visit this cafe always busy. I like their concept about recycling old house into new cafe, without break down the house.
Love their outdoor ceiling, because they use clear ceiling.

A coffee shop that has a unique concept in Malang is different from other coffee shops. It gets an 8/10 for ambiance because it's cute and unique. There are also quite a lot of seats provided, but the place is not too wide for a coffee shop because it is located in a residential area. It looks like this coffee shop is only suitable for chatting with friends and not for doing assignments because the place is quite noisy and crowded, so it's not comfortable if you need a place that's not noisy. For food and drink, I give a rating of 9/10 because it is delicious and unique, and the price is cheap. Various kinds of drinks and food are provided here. From snacks to heavy meals, and in my opinion, all the menus don't fail because they match their appearance with what is on the menu. Service 8.5/10 due to self-service drinks and food delivered by the waitress. Besides that, for those of you who like to take pictures here, a photobox is provided. for which, of course a separate fee is charged.

I do like this cafe! Small, but so comfort! I can say that I will be enjoy and no boring to spend a half day here! The food and drinks are so good!

As soon as I walked in, I was struck by the charming Chinese-themed decor, complete with an impressive collection of antiquities and old photographs of Indonesian landmarks.

The ambiance of the cafe was simply amazing with the old grandma style house and interiors, full of wooden style furniture that added to the overall charm of the place. The windows provided a stunning view of the nearby stream, accompanied by the soothing sound of flowing water. It was the most unique cafe I have ever been to, and I was immediately taken aback by the tranquility and serenity of the surroundings.

The menu was equally impressive, offering a range of delicious food and beverages. I tried their pisang bakar and it was one of the best I've ever had. The rate of the menu is very cheap as well.

All in all, I would highly recommend this cafe to anyone looking for a unique and memorable experience. The ambiance, the food, and the service are all outstanding, making it an ideal place to relax and unwind. I look forward to visiting again soon!

The decoration is superb, it's like an oriental museum. Perfect for someone who loves antique or unique building and someone who loves taking photo. The water sound came from the river and the fish pond make a relaxing ambiance. But sadly, there is no smoking room in this cafe so the visitor can smoking everywhere and it's make me uncomfortable. The taste of main menu is so so and a little bit salty. The tea is good tho. The price is really affordable

This place has so many beautiful spot, including the theme, building style which have unique design both the building and the interior (antique things), the garden, the fish pool and it‚Äôs surroundings that so homey, was really good for instagram and heaven for people who love taking picture. Foods and beverages was average enough. My two cents of this place would be the connection both menus and the ambiece, because the menus not-that-oriental antique, contradicts enough with the ambience.

Good vibes cafe with such a good books collection like Yuval Noah Harari's books. Not that pricey also. The menu's price ranged from around Rp. 10.000 - Rp. 30.000

Oriental style ~look like museum~ coffee shop with lots of antique stuffs inside. Menu is vary, especially light meal with very affordable price.

The coffee served at the coffee shop ""PORTAL COFFEE MALANG"" is coffee from the Malang region. There are Arabica coffees such as Arjuno, Kawi, Parangtedjo, and Selorejo Dau. Then there is Robusta coffee which is a mainstay, namely SRIDONORETNO (DAMPIT) coffee.

Previously, Portal Coffee Malang was one location with The Roots Barbershop Malang. But now the two have moved to separate locations near the old place. The most favorite here is of course the processed coffee. In the afternoon, visitors can also see the coffee roasting process for themselves. There are various types of robusta and arabica coffee beans on offer. Starting from Malang local products and several other areas. Good preparations include palm sugar milk coffee, brewed coffee, V60, afogato, and others. For those who don't like coffee, there are choices of traditional drinks such as wedang uwuh, nasi kencur and turmeric tamarind. Quality and taste to be reckoned with."

So very natural

This ringin spring is a bath whose water is sourced from natural sources and has several bathing pools, for adults, youth and children.

It's not neat, there's not enough play area for children and it's not well maintained.

Tourist attractions above the unspoiled overlapping valley, there are 3 swimming pools, 1 of which is a pool for adults. Entrance ticket is only 10 thousand rupiah. The parking lot is quite spacious.

Besides STMJ there is also a toast menu. It's a perfect match. Drink STMJ and Toast at night. For those of you who like half-cooked free-range chicken eggs, you can also order at this place.

The taste of ordinary pecel is delicious, there are a variety of side dishes and drinks. The food is fresh, the vegetables are fresh, the food looks clean and attractive. The price is affordable. I eat pecel with a side dish of skewered meat, the meat is delicious, I think the pecel is a little less salty, or maybe it's typical for pecel to be served like that.

It's really worth it bro. Pecel is close to UB. The taste is good although not the most delicious. With a price of 10k and quite filling. Very suitable for backpackers who are more economical spending. Oh yes, additional side dishes are also available at various prices but still cheap. The thick omelet is only 2k.

Homey coffee shop just located in housing area. Feels like you drink your coffee inside your own house, even there's a shower in the toilet. There are three spot you can choose here, first is outside in front of the carport, second is inside the house and the third its gonna be the little back yard. The decoration pretty nice, and lovely. About the drinks and beverages, obviously there are a coffee based and non coffee based. I ordered a brahma which is like cranberry with a tonic water i belive, and its really refreshing. Also theres a potato wedges and chocolate toast that quite good. I love the potato wedges, theres like a delicious bolognese sauce. Overall its pretty great!

It offers warm and pleasant ambience, a selected amount of light dishes and affordable price. It comes to my astonishment that they offer a quite tasty meal but cheaper than any other restaurants or cafes. Good job!

nice place, you can get fresh air n good view there. Recomended place for hangout with friends or couple to spend time in afternoon. There are some less tasty foods and beverage in my opinion like you know sausages in noodle menu and traditional drinks ""rempah-rempah"" the taste less good,but over all is okay...

Very cozy and instagram-able place! I guess mostly 'Kera ngalam' (Malang's youth people) knowed this place, because i got the recommendation from my friend in Malang.

The place are very big and wide. Its near from UMM (Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang) campus. There's outdoor&indoor suite room. For you who loves nature vibes, the outside suite room is really high recommended to chosen.

For the menu, there are a lot of food and beverages popular menu, such as 'Pisang Gigit', 'Roti Bakar', 'Hot Chocolate', 'Coffe beer'. I like the 'Kapiten Coffe Beer', you can drunk that beverages safety because its 0% alcohol even using beer as the mixed beverages with coffe. The taste is delicious also.

I gave 5 star without doubtfull, and i highly recommended you guys to visit this place with your friend for hangin' out when you're visiting Malang City!~"

Dizzy Coffee.. French Fries IDR 10,000 But PORTIONS ARE MALANG RAYA CHAMPIONS

Wow, I never thought that in the Ciliwung area, Malang, there is really good coffee..

Product: I ordered Es Coffee Coconut, it tasted really good... my friend, who doesn't like coffee that much, took a sip and immediately said ""mmmm yummmm"". That means it's really good because my friend is the most fussy about food and drink.

Price: the price is standard but in accordance with the taste. The price for Ice Coffee Coconut is only IDR 18,000, guys.. French fries are only IDR 10,000 but the portion, Masha Allah, is a lot, guys, and the taste is really good too...

Place: even though I ordered take away but at first glance I saw that the place was quite comfortable for hanging out... and the location is on the side of the road so it's really easy to find.

Service: friendly service, even though I came with flip flops and all black clothes..

Please, those who miss good coffee can immediately attack the place....

The drinks are great

The place is difficult to find a car park. Very roadside location.

For the price, it's still above the lower limit for cafe prices in Malang, yes, but it's worth it because the place is good, bro, the coffee is also good. Price range if I'm not mistaken 15k-30s

The atmosphere is calm even though the roadside is a bit congested and almost always crowded, especially near gacoan, you know how to do gacoan for yourself

The only minus is the space, which is not too big and not too small, while the plus is that there is an individual seat facing the wall. The seats are actually proportional to the overall space, but I personally think it's a bit too small.

The majority of seats are outdoor, indoor non smoking only 1 seat set, I guess.

The service is a little above standard which is good because the standard is actually already good. If you pay using QRIS (QR Code), the qr code is printed specifically for customer transactions, so you don't need to enter a nominal again like in most cafes today.

Thanks for the experience

So-so.. small place, less parking, really standard coffee.. The image of the Capucinno lgs disappears before you drink it and it's not hot at all"

This cafe is close to residential areas. Here there are various kinds of food and drinks at low prices. In addition, in this cafe there are also rides for games for children, teenagers and adults. Beautiful scenery and cool weather make people who visit the cafe enjoy the atmosphere there more. The car park here is wide, but tourists who use buses must use a motorcycle taxi service to go to the location, because the parking lot is quite far from the location. Apart from that, there tourists can bring souvenirs such as vegetables, fruit, fresh milk and others because there is a market available for shopping.

Great atmosphere, this place for city folks who doesn't connect to the nature on everyday life. Good place for eating some snacks and talks. They have guide to show the place around. This cafe managed by locals. The access to this is through the locals street so be careful when you go there cause there's kids on the road that play around. They have Guest house on this cafe.
The only downside here is that they play music from the speaker. For people like me who works in the city pak enjoying the silence of nature is better than some bad sound from speaker.

it such wonderful and peaceful place for you having holiday with family and friends. we can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the farming field and having snacks in the middle of farm. we can also buy directly from the farm of vegetables that are harvested ü•∞

Overall the cafe sawah itself is ok. Nice view. Service could be improved for better.
Rather difficult to order and take long time to get the food we order. Taste is standard. Ambience is ok. They also have rooftop area. There are some spots to take a picture (perhaps this is its USP Unique selling proposition).

Price is affordable, eventhough some visitors say the price is expensive.
If you want to go here just for eating, you will be disappointed because it is located inside village tourism area so that to enter/reach the restaurant, you have to pay ticket in the locket (12,5K/person) and parking (10k for car).
Payment : cash in major.

Not have experienced

Unpleasant incident buying LPG for the first and last time here, never again. I asked the shop keeper to deliver and install the LPG, the person said yes and I paid 18 thousand. Then I said that the stove is on the 2nd floor. Ok. Then it turned out that he couldn't put the new one on and the tube was dripping, and it was really rusty and it was so bad that I was scared. The reason is that the diameter of the lpg holes is not the same, I have to replace the regulator even though it's new. The one who is at home is his wife. I was even told to be honest right when I was in the shop if I was told to put it on and on the 2nd floor. Eh, sir, where if people can do something, there's not much of an excuse, right? Eh, when he finally gave up, he didn't install it, instead he wanted to go home. I didn't say just bring the new LPG because I was afraid it would leak, I had good intentions to just change the shipping fee because it was really close to the boarding house. And my LPG cylinder was still new and actually the regulator still showed that there was content, it just glowed red. The guy chuckled, didn't want to return the money, instead he said yes, I already have enough money, 18,000 I can't get anything. I said, please, if I lose, I won't get anything, instead the hose and stove are removed. Yes, it's better not to be there, it's still on. The point is I'm disappointed, if I say I'm told to be sincere, that's fine, but the way of selling like that isn't a blessing, sir. Not recommended at all. Such shame to ever purchase from this shop

Pretty close to the mosque

Also, this place is spacious, there are indoor and outdoor space and not so crowded, just perfect! Price range from 17k to 30k something. The staff is friendly too, much love‚ú®Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Plus point for their nice, quiet and cozy ambience. But not a fan for what they serve. Coffee taste not so good, and their mashed potato is bland with no creamy taste at all. Or maybe I just pick the wrong dish? Improve your dishes and drink, and maybe I'll consider another visit.

Will definitely be my favourite coffee shop in Malang. The coffee is superb! Try pour over V60 Gayo wine beans. Sooo light and clear. And surprisingly, it's not really expensive for such a fragrant and tasty coffee. The place? So much greeny and peaceful. It's got a concept a vintage house. A house during Dutch colonization.

They have tropical-industrial decoration, really like cafes in Canggu, and the coconut tree there really fits with the vibe. They sell mainly non-alcoholic drinks, but they provide cold beers as well. Kinda pricey if it's compared with any other cafe in Malang, but still reasonable. Definitely a must visit if you have an occasion in Malang.

Good vibes cafe. The only constraint is hard to fine car parking here. So my suggestion if you wanted to come here, just bring motorcycle or public transportation.

I was here for late lunch and the weather was amazing, I decided to dine in upstairs with air breeze in Malang.
I've ordered Dahayu Tea and the taste was refreshing, its taste sour and sweet smell, just like berries does.

Hospitality was amazing. I enjoyed the quick order proses with the staff and I did not mind to go downstaird to pick up my order and went back again upstairs.

But the meal, I was so sad I had to feel disappointed with this food, the asparagus chicken.
Chicken was served in a hotplate and I hardly wait to try with sauce.

Chicken was hot.
But the sauce was cold as fff, same with the mini croquet and veggies.

I do not know what was going on that day, but all part of meals should served hot. But not for the sauce, even when I mixed the cold sauce and hot chicken, its meal temperature lowering to room tempie.

Not good.

Atmosphere ok strategic lovation but sometimes too noisy due to semi open air and the traffic but the menu, taste and variety are good

A great place to hang out with friends and family! Food and beverages vary, the price range from 20-50 thousand rupiah. At that time I ate fish and chips and green tea, it tastes good and quite filling. Because it is located at a crossroads, so the view is pretty good. There was live music too until about 11pm, and it was very entertaining.

The place is nice, cozy, and clean. The menus are affordable and taste really good, although it may take some time (30-45 minutes) per menu to be served. It's a good place for having online work/class, or even family gatherings

Nice place to havr a dinner..they offer some kind of traditional food and drinks.. i ordered Jahe kencur gula merah, alang2 tea with rosella, rawon blonceng and noodle. Im so happy to find they serve the drinks with the real herbs fulfilling the glass..looks so authentic and traditional..i like the alang2tea with rosella at the most, the scent and taste is so refreshing and healty feels..

great place to hang out, eat and drink with friends. Cozy and clean.Above average than other hangout places in the city of Malang, the price offered is still affordable ranging from Rp. 20,000 to Rp. 45,000 depending on the food you choose.there are indoor and outdoor places, complete with prayer rooms.

came here because one of my friend suggested to try this place. it was good. the ambience was the typical coffee shop with bustling sounds of people hanging out with their friends or clacking sounds of people working from the cafe. the food came out good, but not that tasty. the food was a bit expensive, if I must say.

AADK is a high class concept! One of the best cafe where keeps an indoor and outdoor area. The ambience of the first floor is very suitable to create a warm friendship, sharing love and laugh. There's a photobox there and every corner is so instagramable. The atmosphere of the second floor is really appropriate to engage communication and find solution. There's a space to be a workplace and having intense conversation. The service is good, the menu is also unquestionable, and the price is normal and affordable.

Nice place

one of the hidden gems in my opinion
The tulup coffee is really poor
the natural atmosphere and views of the city of Malang and Batu are clearly visible from here

The cafe which is on the 2nd floor is quite interesting with services that make you feel at home

A cool and cozzy hangout place, Drinks, Food and of course coffee is a favorite menu that is worth trying... the people and the owner are friendly"

Great for outdoor quick photoshoot.
There was an outdoor picnic set up for groups, interesting.

I only go there once, and i think i will think twice to go there again. I appreciate their concept of making a cafe with a nice scenery in the evening. They have some chairs and tables in the yard. So you can have chit chat either with your friends or your boyfriend/girlfriend. I like one of the menu, banana nugget. However, the serious point is that i think the menu are overprice for some ppl like me. Also, they dont offer various menu to be selected.

Cant take a proper picture yet rest assured it was a nice place to hang out. However, i hope that there are more food options in the menu.

Great place to hangout with friends and family. A lil bit cold at night because it's semi outdoor place, don't forget to bring your jacket or warm suit. Super cozy atmosphere!

Good place to chill and spend time with companies or by yourself.
All drinks and snacks are highly recomended with pocket friendly price.
Nice hospitality and cool peacefull ambience.
Also provided clean restrooms and spacious musholla, a huge plus point for this cafe.

MORELOCALGROWING

I feel SYAHDU ATMOSPHERE when I enjoy poor coarse coffee at the shop which is located in this small alley.

Because the location is inaccessible to vehicles, it's better to park on the side of the main road or in the main square.

Arriving at the location, we can choose whether we want to sit on the available benches & tables, or take a stool (plastic chair) and find our own seat along the aisle.

Even though the price of the black brewed coffee is affordable (Rp. 4,000), the taste is very authentic. The coffee tastes thick, according to my taste.

If you don't like regular brewed coffee, Kauman also provides a variety of coffee flavors that are more modern and suitable for today's youth."

I went here twice. The first time I went with my sister. We ordered Horenso salad. It was so good, especially the sauce. It was sour, sweet and something that I can't describe. Also the veggies was so fresh.
I also ordered Chicken steak (for me, it was regular chicken steak) but the sauce was yummy and chicken pop. I am not recommended chicken pop. It was hard. Then, for drink I ordered Green Republic. I like it.
The second time ordered Chicken Fajitas. I think they have specialty in sauce. Again, the sauce was superb. I want more the sauceü•≤.
Last but not least was coffee latte. I don't like it. Just like reguler coffe latte that I made in home.
I didn't see if they have baby chair. Maybe you can asked them if you plan with your baby. I saw prayer place for Muslim and the toilet was cleaned.

If you have plan to Fertisoil I recommend the salad and Chicken Fajitas or something that has sauce. They have special sauces in their menu.

i feel like the price is kinda pricey for a cafe in malang. but i like their egg croissant sandwich! that's good. another well designed cafe in malang, i like their minimalistic concept. even though their place is kinda small, but they have non smoking and smoking area, they even have outdoor area. thinking of coming back someday!"

First, the water wasn't clean. It was dirty. I know it was from the source (When I open the faucet, the water is dirty). But you can consult with PDAM about it.
Second, is the french fries taken from freezer and you cook it anyway? And macaroni was too soft. I hope you can fix these foods soon.

The white nuance, which is also obtained from the fence, some of the furniture, and the door and window frames, makes Bataputi Coffee House a clean and attractive photo backdrop. Coupled with a beautiful cafe environment, surrounded by trees and ornamental plants from the outside to the inside, Bataputi Coffee House has remained as a favorite cafe in Malang since its establishment in 2015.

Many potential photo backgrounds at Bataputi Coffee House. The most favorite is the outer part of the cafe, which has white rattan tables and chairs. We can take photos with 3 backgrounds at once: a wooden gazebo which is part of the smoking area, the Bango River and the trees on its banks that divide Araya Housing, and the magnificent Araya Bridge. Now the chandelier that adorns the Araya Bridge lights up brightly before night falls. Not only does it add to the coolness of your photo background, but it also makes the night atmosphere warm and romantic!

Just open every day at 3 pm, on weekends Bataputi Coffee House starts to get busy at 5 pm. Visitors generally aim to sit in the gazebo and non-smoking rooms that are air-conditioned and have sofas. Besides being a fun place, the food and drinks offered by Bataputi Coffee House are affordable. We tasted two coffee drinks recommended by the friendly cafe staff, namely avocado coffee and the other which is only available on weekends, es kopi susu tempo doeloe.

The coffee in avocado coffee is still quite dominant even though it is served with vanilla ice cream. So if you like light coffee, the creamy tempo doeloe iced coffee is more suitable. Moreover, the special thing is that this milk coffee ice is served with market snacks, the types of which depend on availability.

Heavy meals range from pizza, burgers, to rice, pasta and noodle based ones. Afternoon is the right time for snacking, so we ordered two snacks that cost around tens of thousands of rupiah: fried bananas, gula Jawa and onion rings. The onion rings are crunchy and delicious to eat warmly. However, you must order the Javanese sugar fried banana, which is not sprinkled with meises and cheese as usual, but in a traditional style with a sprinkling of brown sugar and young coconut.

Bataputi Coffee House
Jl. Araya Megah No. 9, Araya City, Malang
Open: Monday-Sunday 15.00-23.00 WIB

One of the best cafes in Malang to relax, unwind, and be close to the nature. It's really difficult finding a caf√© that has a good view and not just fake plants inside the building for pure decorative purpose. Bataputi has a wide selection of food & beverages, and in my experience, they all taste good.

Prices are reasonable, staffs are helpful. Wifi could be improved a little bit, especially in the outdoor area. But all in all, a perfect choice for a 'me time' or to hang out with friends and family.

To be honest I was a bit unsure to come to this place until last month. It was driven by the fact that lots of eatery and coffee house were open offering merely their good look.
Bataputi, however, indeed has good look especially for its interior and location by the river bank,and offers great food. I find the basic menu, such as fried rice, satisfactory. The fresh ingredients and combination of spices bring the savor everyone is looking for. Should one need to indulge in some comfort food accompanied by friendly coffee while enjoying afternoon breeze, Bataputi is the one to visit. The best time to be here is from 3-6 p.m.
The prices might be higher than average around Malang but it worth the money spending for.

Cozy place to hangout, meet up with friends. Banyak pilihan kids friendly

Place was okay, View was good. But for beverages, they can do better."

Korean style cafe. Chicken BBQ nya enak.

One place with the iconic self photo. The menu is quite unique and the presentation is cute. Taste is also worth the price. The interior decoration makes you feel at home for a long time here, until you order 2x while waiting for your wife to take a photo. Oh yeah, there's ice cream too, which you can try. Happy foodies

Came here accidentally, it turned out to be very comfortable and homey
The waiter is good, friendly
For assignments, thesis, studying, it's really suitable because it's not as crowded as the cafe next door
The pastries taste standard and the prices aren't overpriced
The french fries are delicious
Maybe it's a bit disturbed by the traffic because the location joins the photo studio

Actually it could be 5 stars, but when it came at the same time as the event in the air-conditioned room. The plan is to have fun but it can't be done, it's the same. The outdoor part is hot because unfortunately it's hot this afternoon.
The ice cream is delicious and cheap, much more worth it than m*x*e in my opinion."

New coffeeshop in town. I tried Cappuccino Royal (double shots capp) with 20k for the price and I would give 7,8/10 for the taste. The location was so strategic and kind of hectic to find a parking place, but not that hard. They have many menus with affordable price, and snacks. Also has 2 floors and their good services would made me to come back later!

Not bad, there were a lot of food and beverage options and they tasted quite decent for such a little place. Interior is excellent, however the only downside is the small parking area which can be pretty dangerous since it is close to the busy main road.

Good foods, beverages and price. Menus are made specially for students. I think, the Warkop Brewok 2. I give 4 stars review for Warkop Brewok 1, cause of the food and beverage, not the place. Especially because of they serve delicious coffee beer Kapiten.

Local coffeeshop with their specialty: kue Pancong, a thick pancake like desert originally from West Java. Usually crowded.

The atmosphere is good enough to just hang out with some friends. Capacity around 20-25 seats. Quite small but quite adequate for just hanging out.

There is a TV where you can watch TV, there is also a sound system and several musical instruments for small musical performances. Want to show off your music skills in front of your crush on weekly nights? It fits.

Is there Wi-Fi. Ask the cashier for the password.

Toilets are available although quite small. For hitching a pee plus there is a shower too.

The food provided is light. Snacks. Heavy food such as fried tractor wheels with sweet and sour sauce are not available.

Drinks include coffee, tea, hot drinks, and some kind of float.

Prices are not too expensive. Under ten thousand is also there. Up to tens of thousands of rupiah.

It's located in klayatan gg II close to the Kampoeng shop. The place is small, comfortable and beautiful. But if you come here before eating, make sure the table is dust free because the few times I've been here the table is definitely dusty so I clean it with a tissue first.
For a lot of empty menus, there are always noodles. There are many noodle variants that you can choose the topping for.
I recommend Cwie Mie with gizzard liver topping because it tastes great.
For the drink, I recommend the fresh and delicious iced sunrise.
There is also free wifi here, but sometimes it's slow, besides that sometimes you can smell the garbage, which is about 4 houses from the shop.

Really like the coffee vibes at Kayu Tangan. Especially in Wan Chai, the place is clean, comfortable, and also authentic like coffee with the theme of Chinese vibes in general. For the price, I think it's still affordable, and they also offer a menu of heavy meals and snacks. As for the taste of the coffee, it tastes good, the aroma of coffee is quite strong, and it's not too sweet either. For snacks I bought fried gyoza and spring rolls, for the fillings the meat really tastes good, even the fiber is still visible when bitten, the skin is also crunchy and crunchy. good job!

Try Wan Chai Kopitiam in the Kayutangan shopping district of Malang. The main food is hainan rice & dimsum. The drinks are great. the hainan rice uses grilled chicken, tastes good but the portion is not big enough. I don't like the dimsum because there are lots of young bones.

The food is decent, according to the price ..... the atmosphere is quite good and comfortable but it's a shame those who serve make ilfil .... don't show when they are selling and seem forced and just take profit .... sincere and good service, the price is also not that cheap....."

After exploring many coffee shops, I found one coffee shop which I think is really worth it for students like us to visit üòÄ.  Nakoa cafe Bondowoso is one of my favorite hangout cafes, it seems I have visited this cafe countless times.  The reason why Nakoa is my favorite cafe is that most of the people who come here are students doing their assignments, so it makes the atmosphere of the cafe calm and not chaotic.  The people at Nakoa also don't care about visitors, so I think Nakoa is really good for me time.  My favorite menu here is the matcha latte üíö.  Apart from the matcha latte, the drinks here are also delicious.  The price is also standard, which is under 25,000.  Apart from selling drinks, here they also sell some delicious food, moreover, the donuts are really delicious and cheap üòÉ.  For those of you who like to do assignments alone, you can really try this Nakoa cafe.

The place so comfy for works both indoor and outdoor, the coffee is great too. WiFi so fast, the staff so friendly, i have a good experience at Nakoa Cafe, just need some improvement to make the toilet clean. Overall is good, i'll come again to Nakoa Cafe. Waiting for the new menu for filling my tummy.

This is a special place for co-working which makes it also a great coffee shop. Italian espresso machine Simonelli makes nice coffees and you feel like being in a sort of modern museum. Really outstanding design....well done!

Plus point for their nice, quiet and cozy ambience. But not a fan for what they serve. Coffee taste not so good, and their mashed potato is bland with no creamy taste at all. Or maybe I just pick the wrong dish? Improve your dishes and drink, and maybe I'll consider another visit.

Will definitely be my favourite coffee shop in Malang. The coffee is superb! Try pour over V60 Gayo wine beans. Sooo light and clear.

this time I will tell you about my experience and what I feel after visiting this cafe. The first time I visited this cafe with my junior high school friend in Malang, he to be the one who told me about this place. okay, at that time we visited this place at 10 pm, this place is still crowded, it just so happens that this cafe has 3 floors, the first floor is the cashier and also a few tables for visitors, then on the 2nd floor is an indoor room where this room is covered with glass, lots of tables and mostly used by students who want to do assignments. because on the 2nd floor there is no smoking allowed. so it is very comfortable to work in focus. on the 2nd floor there is also a toilet whose design is very futuristic and of course interesting. okay, because at that time I sat on the 3rd floor there was a lively atmosphere, lots of people hanging out with their friends because the rooftop on this floor allowed smoking, there is also a bar here and there are lots of tables on the 3rd floor, we can also see the city lights. and the service at this cafe is quite good, the employees are friendly, but because the place is very busy it makes them a bit of a hassle.

I just passed through Malang and so happen got tired and get some rest here. The cappucino was meh, it taste like instant coffee. The ice cream was nice, I buy kopyor ice cream and it's decent for 15RB price. Not so sweet just as I like it. The place was spacious. Lot's of collage students there getting some work done. Pretty cheap and cozy fast internet and clean. I went to 3rd floor and since Malang is kinda cold that day it's really nice. Overall 7/10. Maybe after taste some dishes I could increase it. Maybe next time

Cheap food and coffee, wide and comfy, dont use 3rd floor if it sunny.. too hot. Okay when at night

WOW is one of the cafes located in Malng City. With a very aesthetic location and suitable for doing tasks because of its convenient and cool location.
There is also live music so we don't get bored to hang out there. However , the prices there do not match student friendly , students and even boarding children like me with drinks priced above 20,000 Because I think it's expensive.

The eggs have been washed first. Every time I buy stmj, martabak, fried rice or all foods made from eggs, I usually don't wash the eggs first so that when cooking, the seller's hands hold the eggs which still have dirt on them. Maybe the reason is that eggs are not easy to stir. But whatever the reason, this of course affects the halalness of the food.
But here the eggs are clean, there is no adhering dirt. It means that the eggs here are holy and unclean. I'm sure STMJ Yassalam is guaranteed to be halal.

Thanks, yassalam, poor poor, actually the taste...the spices taste in the body, the feeling of aches and pains is gone, especially the special one...it's bad luck to drink here...I'm disappointed. It's free, the wifi is clean, the place is clean...the egg milk is normal The fishy smell doesn't smell good....the main thing is...stemj yassalam, opening in Malang is just right because there's been a lot of it so far...now it's here in Malang, the taste is solid...the milk is thick, not runny. ... there is no loss here ... and the price is cheap .... great, jossss, gandooooossss, wesssss .....

Super cozy place. One of the best waffle in town with a lot of delicious toppings. Recommended!

Cool place, good grub. Waffles were tasty and filling, smoothie bowls were yoghurty instead of pure ice which I prefer (smaller than usual but for the price you can't complain, you can literally buy 2 if needs be). Super helpful and friendly guys running it, they helped sort/buy our train tickets and even did scrambled eggs on a waffle for us which they seemed very confused about haha. If you're in Malang, head here.

This place is awesome. Located in front of a house (actually a women center) this place serves you waffle with various and healthy topping. Also, there are smoothies with a lot of healthy nut and seeds. But unfortunately, oftenly when i visit this place is closed, because they have to support outdoor events. But, you have to try it.

Delicious and sweet! Such a great place for hanging out with friends and enjoy good waffles. They also sell healthy food and salty food. The order sometimes can take much time to get but it worth to wait. The price also affordable for student. Recommended!"

Looking for a date place while eating cheaply??? Yes, at Iwak Cafe. This place is really recommended and definitely very instagramable. Apart from being a very strategic place, namely on Jl.

The food is varied and very tasty, the drinks are also okay, you can hang out casually too. Price??? Don't worry because the prices here are really cheap. Don't believe? Prove yourself.

Nice place and coffee like home

A very cute charming cafe. The vintage style is special here. The table legs are made of old sewing machines and the wooden look makes everything very cozy. The owners are a cute little Indonesian family who run the hostel and the cafe themselves. Even the coffee beans are produced on their own farm. We loved that the owners mingled with the visitors to chat with us. Jon and his son are wonderfully humble people who made our stay in Malang unforgettable. We will be back again!

The nuances of Europe, especially the Netherlands, are immediately felt as soon as you enter a cafe called Huize Jon Coffe. This cafe, which is located on Jl Majapahit, Malang City, carries a different theme compared to other cafes. The combination of Javanese and European nuances, especially the Netherlands, is very strong. From the outside, the modern feel of the building greets every visitor who enters the cafe. Meanwhile, when entering the inside of the cafe, a number of Javanese antique objects are immediately visible. A pair of statues of people dressed in traditional Javanese clothes immediately become an icon on the inside. On the inside of the cafe space, there is also a large Dutch language inscription ""Hartelijk Welkom on Malang. Huize Djon Geschickt Voor Het Maken Van Mooie Uitstapjes Gezzelige Sfeer Voor Iedere Gast"". The writing has the real meaning of Welcome to Malang. Several ancient European and Javanese ornaments, ranging from classic wall clocks made in Germany that are more than 75 years old, televisions, old radios, various leather puppets, classic photographs, to ancient carvings to decorate the sides of the cafe.
The Dutch nuance is also increasingly felt with the inscription in Dutch on the north side of the room, namely 'Uitsmijter Toast'. Uitsmijter itself is the name of a typical Dutch sandwich, while toast means toast.
For the menu offered at Huize Jon, there are various processed coffees such as Original Wine Robusta Coffe, Van Den Berg Wine Robusta Coffe, French Press, Americano, and several other processed coffees. However, for the superior menu at this place, visitors need to try the Dutch special Huize Jon coffe, which is Dutch coffee slightly adjusted to be suitable for consumption by the people of Malang. For menus other than coffee, there are several other choices, such as milkshakes, tea, chocolate, or even ginger. Apart from drinks, this place also provides a food menu, such as french fries, indomie, spring rolls, sandwiches, and several other menu choices written in Dutch, such as Gebakken aardappelen, Vleeskroketjes met mustard, Pannekoek, and various other choices.

Coffee shop that has old skool vibes. serves a variety of coffee and non-coffee drinks and other snacks at affordable prices.

Clean place, pin point map according to location, and there is lodging too.

Huize Jon Wine Coffee is the one you have to try!!
The ""Koffie Met Slagroem"" is also delicious but in my opinion too sweet.

The owner is friendly and likes to greet customers. Thank You"

As a non coffee lover. The butter coffee is not bitter and tasted good. The fried noodle is decent. A bit too sweet for my preferences. Crowded and smoking area but overall good

Best kopitiam in malang town so far
I have tried some kind of places in malang, and i found that this place is the best overall
I like the butter coffee, not to sweet not to strong
I like the kaya butter toast too. It is a perfect combination.
I ordered the other food too, and all was good. The price is really affordable.
But, there is not enough chair and table. You have to queue for about 10-20 minutes. N.b i came at 10 am
Definitely will come back next time

oldschool kopitiam that everyone would love! it's located near train station, so we made a short visit to takeaway some food to be enjoyed in train. overall it tasted good with affordable price

If you like retro places, you must try this coffee shop. The vibes of this place is like 80s Singaporean coffee shops, who served Coffee, Milk Tea, Bread, and Half-boiled Egg. The coffees are great, their must try are the Butter Coffee and Coffee with Evaporated Milk. But if you like the classic, their Classic Black Coffee is a bomb. Also the Kaya Butter Bread! Sweetness from the Kaya jam and the saltiness of the butter mixed very well, it's delicious! Their menu is not too much, just a bit snacks like Cireng, Mendoan and Ngo Hiong (this one, very recommended!!), also the main course, like Fried Bakmee (a bit too sweet for me, but still delish!) and Soup Bakmee. Also the ambience, it's very cozy and calm, you'll want to spend hours here if you love the old city vibes. Definitely gonna come back if I visit Malang again!"

But not with their interior design, so similar with Starbucks. Let's say it's a local Starbucks. It feels like they don't have their own characteristics. Still better for me, since they have excellent staff and their coffee is superb!

After exploring many coffee shops, I found one coffee shop which I think is really worth it for students like us to visit üòÄ.  Nakoa cafe Bondowoso is one of my favorite hangout cafes, it seems I have visited this cafe countless times.  The reason why Nakoa is my favorite cafe is that most of the people who come here are students doing their assignments, so it makes the atmosphere of the cafe calm and not chaotic.  The people at Nakoa also don't care about visitors, so I think Nakoa is really good for me time.  My favorite menu here is the matcha latte üíö.  Apart from the matcha latte, the drinks here are also delicious.  The price is also standard, which is under 25,000.  Apart from selling drinks, here they also sell some delicious food, moreover, the donuts are really delicious and cheap üòÉ.  For those of you who like to do assignments alone, you can really try this Nakoa cafe.

The place so comfy for works both indoor and outdoor, the coffee is great too. WiFi so fast, the staff so friendly, i have a good experience at Nakoa Cafe, just need some improvement to make the toilet clean. Overall is good, i'll come again to Nakoa Cafe. Waiting for the new menu for filling my tummy.

This is a special place for co-working which makes it also a great coffee shop. Italian espresso machine Simonelli makes nice coffees and you feel like being in a sort of modern museum. Really outstanding design....well done!

I think the doughnut is a normal doughnut. It has no speciality, except the price, 9k ü§≠
The coffe was also tasty as normal coffe.
We can freely take a mineral water.

The place is quite large and cozy for having chit chat"

Java Dancer located in a quiet residential area. It is small enough to seat about 15 people, and the interior is as cute as its pretty name. Even though it is early for dinner, there are 7-8 locals seated. Ordered a salad and chicken for coffee and a light meal. Quantity is more than expected. Delicious coffee and food. But Salad is so salty.

After a hot day wandering lost and stressed around Malang, this was such a relaxing place to cool off. We felt so happy and relaxed in this beautiful shop, surrounded by plants and the sound of bubbling water.

They have single origin coffees from around Indonesia, which can be brewed in five different ways. This was fun to tour. We tried the Kintamani brewed in a siphon, which was mild, with a mango juice they prepared with 100% mango and cream. So refreshing! It's a little expensive as they have some extra charges for certain taxes, which was explained in the menu. Just don't be surprised by the bill.

The ambiance is the strongest point, along with a great menu of drinks and food.

Cosy open air caf√© with extensive menu for both international and local food! We came here for the espressos and they really hit the spot! We indulged on an affogato and ginger latte as well as some delicious pancakes and roti bantal with chocolate!

Wonderful decor and experience for a foreigner like me to see the batik, masks and other traditional puppets. We went between meals but The food looked amazing and I would love to go back and try it.

Ordered hot cappuccino with extra shoot..They used their specialty house blend coffee..

I service of the place is good about the person, but they are not ready with few things such as tissue and the refund (uang kembalian) doesnt prepare well.

Semusim Cafe is on St. MT. Haryono Malang, exactly across from Brawijaya University. This cafe has two floors which are always busy every day with visitors who are mostly students. This cafe sells cheap food and drinks so it is suitable for student pockets, prices start from 7,000 to 20,000. This cafe is open every day, open from 10.00 to 00.00. This cafe has a Scandinavian decoration concept so it is very interesting to visit. and apart from that this cafe also has air-conditioned first floor facilities, there are sockets on each table without worrying about running out of battery, as well as a prayer room for Muslim visitors. Meanwhile, the second floor is a smoking zone as well as a place to carry out tasks. This floor cafe is non-AC, it won't feel hot because of the lots of ventilation and the use of fans to provide extra comfort to visitors.

Price is so affordable. Taste is okay not so extraordinary, only got the problem with too much sweetness for the drink. Place is well and nice, so comfy and having a decent interior.

Love the atmosphere and the food.
It is worth the price. And it is quite cheap compare to other cafes in Malang.

However, it took soooo much time for the food to be ready. Maybe because it's always crowded with people.
Also, they played the music so loud. So you might reconsider to visit this place if you like a quiet place. But they also provide a special room for study or work, so you might use that.

Don't ride a car to visit this place, it's hard to find the parking lot.

Strategically located accross the uni. Very affordable price, cute interior, nice ambience (although mostly very crowded), food taste exceeds my expectations."

Good coffee

The place is in the corner next to Timezone, the mas and mbk are friendly, for a good taste the iced coffee milk isn't bitter, you can pay using ovo too

Coffee promises the soul of one of the coffee hits. In Malang there are several branches. There are various kinds of coffee such as milk coffee, chocolate, cocopresso, black coffee, soy matcha latte. There are also those without coffee such as matcha milk, yuzu yogurt, hojicha milk, grass jelly milk. For toppings, there are grass jelly, extra espresso, matcha ice cream, vanilla ice cream, pearl. Prices are standard with other places.

One of the modern coffee shop in Malang city. It is located on the 2nd floor of Malang Toen Square, right in the corner close to the time zone. The shop is quite small. There are only two small tables here, so it will be very difficult for you to enjoy coffee on the spot. Serves a variety of processed coffee and tea.

Sorry in advance üôè,
It's been quite a while since I was last there, but in general what I remember is, the stmj was too runny and the ginger didn't taste good, then at that time what I really remember was that there was service that seemed indifferent, because everyone was busy with their gadgets.

A nice place to hangout and enjoy a warming drink, also equipped with wifi and various group games

the baristas are friendly, the menu is affordable, and for the place is not too spacious but comfy enough.

Such a great place to hangout with some friends (but not too much). Roomy and spacious. FnB is just great and taste very good. One beverage to try is Rum with milk and biscuit.

Only one thing, this place closed at 9.30 pm. So, better not to come here late at night.

Apart from drinks and snacks, this cafe also provides heavy meals such as rice with chicken skin. Usually, if you come here, you always order red velvet and green tea in large sizes. with prices starting from IDR 4,000, this cafe has been able to attract many consumers. The advantage of this cafe is that it is located quite strategically behind UIN and the prices are affordable for student pockets, the drawback is that the place is quite cramped

KopiStudio24 has always been my favourite coffee shop in Malang because This coffee shop is open 24 hours hehe. I usually go there with my friend or alone when I want to drink something sweet or want to eat ice cream. The staff is very humble, the place is very suitable for study because there are so many electric plugs available there.
Their drinks menu are great especially the one with the avocado coffee base and milk tea boba, I really love it! This is a good place to chill alone or with friends haha! The another menu were all tasty like the ice cream. There are sooo many flavors to choose from and I recommend the ice cream with mango jam because it tastes so fresh. As for the food menu, I like the cireng rujak seasoning because it's savory and don't forget the sweet pancong with chocolate cheese flavor. But this is less recommended  to come on weekends because it's very crowded and long queues because the place is not too big. Oh, there is also a large prayer room available here!  If you‚Äôre up for a cozy place and affordable price for students then this is a must place to visit. thanks!.

Open 24 hours, offers variety of drinks and snacks. It has an indoor area and also outdoor area. Could be crowded at busy hours. The price is very affordable. The taste is also acceptable.

Tasty and affordable

The coffee is nice. I ordered one Americano on the spot, ordered the creamy ones through GrabFood and they were nice. I have also tasted the snacks like Pancong with Ovomaltine, Cireng and the banana one, and they were nice, especially the Cireng's rujak sauce.

The only thing that matters for me was the rice. I ordered it through GrabFood and found it dried."

One of my favorite place to hangout. Cafe with Scandinavian concept design. The food and coffee is good, i love their lasagna, super duper mouth watering! Big portion with affordable price.

The outdoor area is so comfy with pool and coffee table with chair, while the indoor area is bright, clean and cozy. The toilet is big and clean.

I really like this place, definitely would come back and be my choice to spend my time to leisure or working. This restaurant concept is Scandinavian themed, from the design, language, choice of food on the menu, and anything in it.

The taste of their food especially the fried rice is excellent, very tasty and lot of beef. The drink is also good. The snacks i bought, french fries, is also good on the sauce. Tha price is fair with the taste and quality. The place overall is also good and well built.

There are plenty of seat, outdoor, indoor, either on first or second floor. Lot of facility is available, toilet, musholla, valet parking for car, etc. The staff is also friendly and kind, and their service is made me satisfied. There's also live music on weekdays night if I'm not mistaken. They also sell bread here, so there's a bakery or patisserie in here.

went here for brunch and it was perfect. The place was great, every single spot is absolutely instagram worthy. Various menu from snacks, desserts and drinks and they're ALL so pretty. Most of the customers come with their friends or family. Or you can just go by yourself, doing some online task from laptop while enjoying some of their snacks

It's a little bit crowded in the weekend, but still can enjoy the good atmosphere. You can enjoy a life music here. For me, I don't really like the atmosphere if want to spend a long day :("

I ordered asem asem bola daging, the food looks very nice and i was really craving for this, but one thing was that i couldn‚Äôt eat spicy food for today for particular reason. When i ordered the food, ive asked the waiter TWICE wether the food was spicy or not, and the waiter has confirmed, that it‚Äôs not spicy, yes he confirmed it twice and i heard it very clearly about every single word that he said that the food ISNT SPICY, i believed it and gave it a chance. I have placed all my hopes for this food but when the food came, it came with tons of chili, it wasn‚Äôt even 5 or 10, it was more than 10. I tried to separate the chili from the soup but it didn‚Äôt do anything, this made me very dissatisfied. When the waiter had said that this asem asem wasn‚Äôt spicy AT ALL, and turns out it was very VERY spicy. The steak was also raw, and the sauce taste was normal, i wont even say its worth for my money. This restaurant is disappointing."

After trying to migrate from foreign products, now I'm starting to explore local products created by close relatives.
One of them is like SKUNK PIZZA, imagine that with only 25k you can get your dream pizza with requested toppings and mozzarella cheese.
The location is Singosari, it just so happens that my friends who are in the Malang area can come closer to Singosari. For those of you who are in Singosari, you can order an online motorcycle taxi.
Enjoy your food todayyy !!

I really like eating pizza a la chef dhevanata..
The bread is really soft and the toppings are also fresh..guaranteed you will be addicted..love it anyway...

Enough for the first 3... You have to learn to better understand the situation and the difference between the customer and the driver who bought it... Drivers need faster time when taking gfood orders. Fresh its ok.. But more experience will be more than the other... It means... Learn from previous experience to be more fast and furious... Differentiate between drivers and regular customers... ü§≠ ü§≠ ü§≠

Recommended pizza, if there are 10 stars I will give 10 stars. The taste is not inferior to pizza hut, with friendly prices. Want to buy again ü§≠ü§≠

Handmade not instant...
Home products are not cheap...
The ingredients are fresh, not leftovers from yesterday.
Just prove it...."

Please buy here. To always be careful, ask the price first and have to fill in the price yourself according to the menu book.
Because I was with 2 groups of small cars taking a break here, the prices on the menu book and on the bill of payment, the difference was all aliases were expensive.

First thought in choosing this place was because it has a photobox which allow us to make memories while we were there. This cafe serves as usual cafe: good ambience, nice for hang out. You can stay as long as you can. The place is clean and super huge. Do not worry for not getting an empty seat. However, taste wise and food presentation-wise this cafe offer ordinary experience. Food weren‚Äôt top notch, as wel as the beverages. Good place for hang out yes, good place for eating? Think again.

great place to hang out, eat and drink with friends. Cozy and clean.Above average than other hangout places in the city of Malang, the price offered is still affordable ranging from Rp. 20,000 to Rp. 45,000 depending on the food you choose.there are indoor and outdoor places, complete with prayer rooms.

came here because one of my friend suggested to try this place. it was good. the ambience was the typical coffee shop with bustling sounds of people hanging out with their friends or clacking sounds of people working from the cafe. the food came out good, but not that tasty. the food was a bit expensive, if I must say.

AADK is a high class concept! One of the best cafe where keeps an indoor and outdoor area. The ambience of the first floor is very suitable to create a warm friendship, sharing love and laugh. There's a photobox there and every corner is so instagramable. The atmosphere of the second floor is really appropriate to engage communication and find solution. There's a space to be a workplace and having intense conversation. The service is good, the menu is also unquestionable, and the price is normal and affordable. JUST COME OVER AND INVITE ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS/FAMILIES! YOU WILL FEEL THE COMPLEXITY OF PEACEFULNESS AND BEYOND EXPECTATION! üî•

Kouja is instagramable place for you to hang out and gathering with your friends. Has a photobooth. This place is also able to be a venue of the event.

Great new cafe with different concept

The location is a row of cafes.
The parking is wide.

It just seems unkempt. The location is in front of Sarijan Cafe. Very spacious inside, perfect for assignments and meetings.

If you say it's instagramable, in my opinion 7/10 depending on the motto, you have to have flat angels.

Service... it seems the staff is minimal, so it's not optimal, when I went there in the afternoon before maghrib. That's it, there's no food. Drinking is also limited. And the taste of the coffee is not worth the price. I feel like Nescafe ü§≠At that time I was a student and I was there. Why did he say this drink tastes like pop iceüòÖ

There are toilets and mushollah, just like that, I want to go to the toilet and the mushollah is really not clean, heaps of piles of gt. The toilets are clean, the mushollah needs to be cleaned especially for prayer.

If cleanliness is not maintained and the quality of the food is not improved, you are worried that you will go out of business, especially since there are so many cafes around that are much cleaner and cheaper and taste good.

The place is really spacious, there are lots of plugs, the wifi is pretty fast, the toilets and prayer rooms are also okay, the parking lot is spacious and there's no parking lot, wow, student prices and the taste is okay. Overall it's solid."

The view of the city and surrounding hills was breathtaking and added to the overall experience. The coffee itself was average in taste, but the view and the novelty of the ordering process made it memorable. 3 stars for the coffee and 1 extra for the view and unique experience.

they sell coffee beans and roasted by themselves.
i tried the cappucinno, they use arabica coffee for the espresso and it's good.
the minus is the toilet separated with the cafe (sharing toilet) and it's not clean :(

Been trying all their menus, and their signature just the best.
Cozy places divided by smoking and non smoking room.
If you want to find a comfortable, homie coffee shop with no buzz crowded, this just the right place to go.

My favorite spot is in the corner next to their roasting room, on non smoking area or you even can called it coworking space. colokan dimana mana, banyak tanaman. Makanannya enak (they just opened their Aromatic Kitchen).

And their hospitality just the best!

Good for group, good for self, but just remember to avoid the rush hour.

Located on Brawijaya campus, but not only for students.
Perfect place to study or chill, with an amazing quality of coffee.
Lunch and dinner is also possible, a little bit european style, as well as local dishes.

Definitely recommended!

On the picture, you can see a grill chicken ceasar salad, prepared with less fat and souce on the side!

The place, for it's part of UB, is quite comfortable to hang out in. It has prayer room (musholla) and restroom available for the guests. I guess the menu has been changed since the first time I visited the place. I think, some food are somewhat pricey. The chicken salad is great, so is the tomyam soup. But the snacks are overpriced since they, in my opinion, are far from satisfying.

Really comfy place for chilling as its spacious and the ac is cool.

The beverage was good but the cookies, not recommended for me.. Sorry.

Nice place

cozy place.

The coffee tastes good, especially for that price. The honey dew lemon drink is actually delicious, but what kind of leaves are in it, the leaves are already half brown ü•≤ Instead of forcing them to use brown leaves, I think it's better not to. If it's already wilted, then there's almost no aroma either"

Both floors are comfortable. I like how it's not packed with smokers so you can do work nicely on the 2nd floor. Food and beverages are nice too. Tried both desserts and  slightly heavy meal, for me it's worth the price. Will try others in the future. Staffs were super nice too.

one of my fav cafe, all the drinks are delicious, dessert and meal are good in taste, the price so cheap but the taste are good,comfortable for chilling with friend,they have a lot varians menu, the place are clean with good service,the parking area is not wide.

Overall, it was a pleasant experience dining out here. We orderes several dishes: Chicken Nanban, Meatball something and Matcha Kitkat Cake. For the drinks, we had Cappucino Caramel Crumble and Buttercookies Tea.
The foods taste great. I could tolerate the crunchiness of the chicken katsu, while the sauce completes it really well. It's savory and creamy.
The Meatball also kinda startled us because they use some kinda strawberry sauce. It's new for us. Surprisingly, its sourness and sweetness don't overpower the savory taste of the meatball and mashed potato.
For the dessert, I picked the matcha cake. I could really taste the matcha flavor out of it while its not being too sweet. I love it.
I'd probably revisit the place to try another cake on the selections.

Katamichi is 1 of the best and comfiest cafe in town. It's decoration is awesome and cute. Food and baverage here is delicious, you gonna find them cute and lovely as well. Recommend this place for hang out with your friend or do your work. Their tea and cake is super recommended. You also gonna find some cute stuff there!
Everything will be perfect if the place have Japanese song on their Playlist, so the ambience is truly Japanese.

The mille crepes are delicious and fulfilling. The coffee is strong and good."

I tried the beans that won 3rd place in world championship and also magic that use competition milk. But since they have some interesting appetizer menus, I also tried nachos. Overall imo, coffees are quite good with affordable price for such experience and histories. Nachos were very good too, but the combination with coffee were not working well. Ambience is good too for hangout or work. Worth to try and will come back again.

This place is great for you who wanna spend some quality time with friends while enjoying good costly dishes and drinks. They serve selections of signature coffee. I tried their Vegan Fuel something, consisting of soy milk, espresso and sugar. I actually loved it. For the food, I ordered their beef blackpepper rice. To me, it's just fine.
Unfortunately, since there was no indoor seating available, we had to pick outdoor tribune to enjoy our orders and it wasn't a nice experience. The weather was windy and a bit chilly, so you can imagine how uncomfortable it is. Plus, the tribune is not suitable for eating something served on a plate.

Went here for brunch and it was very perfect, the place was great, every single spot is absolutely instagram worthy.

Various menu from snacks, desserts and drinks and they're all so pretty and yummy. the cafe owner is very friendly to his customer.

The parking area is so wide. Once I enter the coffee shop, the waitress offered me to sit in the indoor area with sofa because she saw me with a baby. It has online order system with e-payment, but don't worry we can still pay with cash.
It's so comfortable because it also has praying room which is so clean.

Complete package. Nice place just to hang or dine in. Good food, awesome coffee.
The basic ice americano with fruity beans, not my personal preference but still, great!
The white butter rum by far is favorite. Price is reasonable too.
Good job!"

Nice

cheapest yet the most creamy coffee that i ever tasted.

One of the coffeeshops in Malang. The location is very strategic, close to campus. located on Jalan Raya Manunggal Sudimoro Malang City.

This place comes with an interesting concept. The place is also very spacious. Inside and to the side there are also flowers. The place is fun and very comfortable. There are indoor and outdoor areas which are both spacious and comfortable. Also there is an area above the 2nd floor which is very spacious.

The menu at this Coffeeshop varies both coffee and non-coffee and the prices are pocket-friendly. Good service. So for that, friends who want to drink coffee or hang out with friends. This place can be an option if you are in Malang.

I like the coffee, chill if I'm not mistaken (9/10)
Cookies (9/10) because it's fat and has chocolate filling in it
Churros with Tiramisu Sauce (9/10)
And my friend's cold drink I don't know how it tastes because I can't drink cold anymore
Instagrammable, friends
You can park the car in front of it or go a little further on the right side of the road, under a tree if you want it's better

With a relatively cheap price, especially for the size to buy at the Tea Break mall, it's really cheap. Usually the queue is quite long.. The portion is also medium, not too small/too big; just right.. My favorites are Choco milk and Brown sugar milk. Recommended.

TEA BREAK really deserves 5 stars from me! the place is really big and in my opinion the booth is the widest than the other drink stands. the employees are friendly. no one is jutek like that. really really fun. the cup seal is strong. I once bought a lot and until the house there is no leak at all. it still tastes good too. My favorite is the matcha milk variant! it's really good, it's cheap again. really don't disappoint. tea breaks also often hold giveaways, you know, friends. Try to follow Instagram, I'm sure there will be lots of promo announcements or Gitcuu giveaways. anyway, for all of you boba lovers, you really have to try a tea break!

There are various drinks here which I think are quite fresh at affordable prices. Starting from pure tea to milk tea, there is. Student price range. It's located on the top floor of MOG's Foodcourt. Can request less ice yeeey. The service is fast enough, so it's recommended for those who are in a hurry"". My fav menu is green tea milk tea topping grass jelly & thai milk tea. I prefer grass jelly because it's easier to chew hehe. If boba is delicious, but chewing makes it a bit sticky on my teeth. Happy holidays üôÄ

Surprised to see the very spacious area of this cafe. I like their cozy setting, plenty of seating options, and the playlist, wifi, and electrical socket are suitable to do some work.

Price is very affordable, and their matcha tastes quite good.

However, the food menu is limited and most of them are stored cold (they just reheat them when we order). Also, the bathroom is only available on the first floor.

Nice cafe with great ambience. Not too crowded so it's suitable for studying. The food is average but the tea is delicious. Definitely will go back here. The place is quite hidden, in the 2nd floor of a building.

It is located on the second floor of Wikacell on Soekarno Hatta street. It's a cozy place to work, study, or just hangout with friends. Menus are varied and reasonably priced. There is a toilet on the first floor and a prayer room on the third floor. Overall this cafe is very comfortable.

Great location for relaxing in the afternoon, delicious cappuccino just right, coffee isn't bitter

The place is good if you take a sit-down break after shopping. Next to it there is an ATM and cheap ice cream. But for the concoctions it's not suitable, especially those that aren't coffee. Maybe you can test it again because to be honest it tastes weird especially the white lychee drink

Yesterday when I was here it suddenly rained, soo a bit wet because the sandals also dripped water from the roof. Supported by ambyar songs, it's getting better.

For food: it's delicious. It's just that yesterday when I ordered, it wasn't very dry. So there's no ""burnt"" appearance, the impression is that it's just warmed up for a while and also if you don't ask for seasoning, don't add more seasoning.. Finally I asked the waitress to burn it until it was a little burnt. Plus asking for spices.. So that the food tastes better..

The best food here is SATE SKIN which is really the winner hehehee..

Continue to be successful.

It's been a long wait, I've been waiting for 1 hour, the order hasn't arrived yet, from 21:26 to 22:34, until we finally come to the place of order, and it turns out that the order has not yet been processed, it is still in the bottom pile before being processed, finally waiting 15 more minutes for orders to be taken wrapped, taken home, no longer eaten on the spot.

Nice place to have a small meet up with your friends, strategic location, delicious snack, and good ""STMJ"" which literally means drink made of Milk, Egg, Honey and Ginger. And remember if you intend to come on Saturday night, this place will be a little bit overcrowded.

My first time going there
I went there around 10pm and it was so crowded
Tbh it was so cold, so if you can't bear the coldness, prepare your jacket, since it's Malang's night.
This was the first stmj i drink in malang.
Oh, STMJ means Susu Telur Madu Jahe (Milk with egg, honey and ginger)
I ordered regular STMJ and my friend ordered chocolate SMJ (Milk with honey and ginger), also some tofu and toast
It was so crowded and it was Saturday, that we wait the drink for 40 minutes.
Bcs it was my first time there, idk wether that was categorized as long time or not.
But we waited the drink and food for long time ( in my opinion ).
The stmj was good, I didn't feel the raw egg.
And the tofu was smooth. The toast also good.
Overall, all fine, except the time we used for waiting. But it's okay.

Good prices. With street place. A lot of variant of food. Good portion of the food. But maybe little bit not comfort if you sit out.

Service is top notch, place is cozy, not too crowded, song playlist is also great. Food is good (chicken quesadillas and their Japanese salad are must-have). Will come back often!

It‚Äôs really nice and cozy cafe with tropical ambience, you‚Äôll feel in Bali once you step in their gate. All the food and drinks that I ordered was good with fast service.

Bit pricy maybe for the city but yes it's worth a fine dining experience ! Taste so delicious and yet plating was awesome!! Quiet for meeting  or dating ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©very recommended . 2 tumb for the chef !!

I went here twice. The first time I went with my sister. We ordered Horenso salad. It was so good, especially the sauce. It was sour, sweet and something that I can't describe. Also the veggies was so fresh.
I also ordered Chicken steak (for me, it was regular chicken steak) but the sauce was yummy and chicken pop. I am not recommended chicken pop. It was hard. Then, for drink I ordered Green Republic. I like it.
The second time ordered Chicken Fajitas. I think they have specialty in sauce. Again, the sauce was superb. I want more the sauceü•≤.
Last but not least was coffee latte. I don't like it. Just like reguler coffe latte that I made in home.
I didn't see if they have baby chair. Maybe you can asked them if you plan with your baby. I saw prayer place for Muslim and the toilet was cleaned.

If you have plan to Fertisoil I recommend the salad and Chicken Fajitas or something that has sauce. They have special sauces in their menu.

i feel like the price is kinda pricey for a cafe in malang. but i like their egg croissant sandwich! that's good. another well designed cafe in malang, i like their minimalistic concept. even though their place is kinda small, but they have non smoking and smoking area, they even have outdoor area. thinking of coming back someday!"

In my opinion, this concept is more of a takeaway coffee, so it's perfect for those of you who want coffee but are in a hurry.. But there are also a number of tables and chairs for you to sit on and hang out there.
Btw, the cup is bigger than the usual coffee milk.

The chicken fillet is delicious. Can add additional cheese sauce. Several levels of spiciness are available. There are various snack choices such as chicken, mushrooms, sausages, dumplings, and so on. Prices are cheap too. Due to the pandemic, it looks like it's only for take away. There are free sauces such as seaweed sauce, bbq, mayo and balado. Good and fast service.

There are 3 seating options, two, four, six, in crowds

The location is on the side of the road, it's just that because the design of the building is rather low and inward, so for those who are new to it, it might be missed. The price is cheap, some of the seats are cross-legged, some are on the bench.

The eggs have been washed first. Every time I buy stmj, martabak, fried rice or all foods made from eggs, I usually don't wash the eggs first so that when cooking, the seller's hands hold the eggs which still have dirt on them. Maybe the reason is that eggs are not easy to stir. But whatever the reason, this of course affects the halalness of the food.
But here the eggs are clean, there is no adhering dirt. It means that the eggs here are holy and unclean. I'm sure STMJ Yassalam is guaranteed to be halal.

Special eel, just chew it without feeling the bones, it's not complicated with bones, hahaha.

Cheap prices, can be eaten on the spot and available to drink.
Located under the gate, Jl. Cendrawasih Bay.

Lalapan near the house, it's been a long time since lalapan, really a favorite, if you buy it, just ask to fry it with flour because it's really crispy and delicious, the best recommendation is the fried eel with flour, it's really good, no bones, crispy mushrooms, and also crispy intestines, affordable prices, and the ones What makes you collect the most is the chili sauce, it's really delicious, different from the usual chili sauce.

Homey is one word to describe this place since the the location is exactly inside a residential area. A tad bit too small to me, though. Ordered Bakpao Tiga Jaya and Es Milo Malaysia, and wow, the bakpao is big... I say, BIG, and I absolutely love it, it tastes great too. The Es Milo Malaysia tastes nice as well. The only thing missing was the cats, where are them??? I was looking forward to meeting the cats that's usually shown in their Instagram... Or maybe I just came at the wrong moment. Would visit again for the cats.

The place is quite small but not that bad. I like their milo iced!

First, the water wasn't clean. It was dirty. I know it was from the source (When I open the faucet, the water is dirty). But you can consult with PDAM about it.
Second, is the french fries taken from freezer and you cook it anyway? And macaroni was too soft. I hope you can fix these foods soon.
For customers, it's still worth to have lunch/dinner here. The ambience is great, the taste is upper-mid, and I think this place is instagramable.

Refreshment drinks, a variety of milk beverages, either with ginger, spice-herbals, honey and/or egg yolks. Since 1974, it started as a family business and remains until now, in a narrow alley of Malang urban dwelling.

Ada gorengan, kerupuk, keripik dan roti bakar jg sbg side dish :)

Bisa buat nongkrong..

A must try

perfectly how to mix and brew from starting with boiling milk mixed with eggs, honey and ginger stirred evenly with care so that it produces best rich and  soft taste without a fishy smell of egg.

serving since 1974 they told, what makes this place is special because they pour honey so generous to your glass. So the taste is quite a bit too sweet for me and my brothers. I also try their TMJ jaddam, more spicy than their STMJ. This place doesnt have a proper car parking, so if you bring car to this place, you will park in front of some house near STMJ pak sentot"

Probably the most impressive thing this cafe can offer is the ambience of the surrounding. Very vibrant as many random people are wandering. The coffee itself is good, but not great. Price wise is affordable, pretty much similar to other similar cafe types. Come here with 3 to 4 friends and enjoy coffee time.

the place is comfortable, there is also a prayer room, so there is no need to bother looking for another place to pray.

I love this place. A really cheap coffee with killer taste! Taste and smell it, but the most important thing was having a conversation with random people was great. Unfortunately, if you are an anti-smoke person, don't visit this place, too many smoke of cigarettes but it is good for social interraction!

Design is unique

It's my first time here, I'm quite disappointed. Ordered crispy chicken, tofu, tempeh, ginger, and genbira soda.. half an hour of waiting was not finished.. It was great because there was a viewing schedule and the result was 30 minutes late watching.. total waiting for food to be cooked for 45 minutes (maybe more). Even drinking takes a long time (not given at the beginning... brg eat it) Sorry for an honest review, üôè. Maybe the cooking staff is lacking or the ingredients have run out so they are forced... the problem is when we ordered, they also asked if the stock was still available or not (?)
About the standard taste, because the price is quite cheap, the size of a mall... I hope it can be better and more crowded üôè

Clean, not crowded, comfortable, can be indoor or outdoor, so those who need a smoking area can really do it, those who don't want to can also hang out comfortably inside.
You can drink coffee, eat, snack or something else too, if you want while you don't want to watch, you can do that too.
Sarinah's location is very strategic.
Good for appointments..

Semusim Cafe is on St. MT. Haryono Malang, exactly across from Brawijaya University. This cafe has two floors which are always busy every day with visitors who are mostly students. This cafe sells cheap food and drinks so it is suitable for student pockets, prices start from 7,000 to 20,000. This cafe is open every day, open from 10.00 to 00.00. This cafe has a Scandinavian decoration concept so it is very interesting to visit. and apart from that this cafe also has air-conditioned first floor facilities, there are sockets on each table without worrying about running out of battery, as well as a prayer room for Muslim visitors. Meanwhile, the second floor is a smoking zone as well as a place to carry out tasks. This floor cafe is non-AC, it won't feel hot because of the lots of ventilation and the use of fans to provide extra comfort to visitors.

Price is so affordable. Taste is okay not so extraordinary, only got the problem with too much sweetness for the drink. Place is well and nice, so comfy and having a decent interior.

Love the atmosphere and the food.
It is worth the price. And it is quite cheap compare to other cafes in Malang.

However, it took soooo much time for the food to be ready. Maybe because it's always crowded with people.
Also, they played the music so loud. So you might reconsider to visit this place if you like a quiet place. But they also provide a special room for study or work, so you might use that.

Don't ride a car to visit this place, it's hard to find the parking lot.

Strategically located accross the uni. Very affordable price, cute interior, nice ambience (although mostly very crowded), food taste exceeds my expectations."

Original fresh milk is delicious. STMJ is great. While the ginger is spicy joss. Soto is also delicious. Unfortunately the spring rolls just ran out. Next time will come here again.

There is a large selection of toppings & drinks. Mas, cook Indomie for about 15-20 minutes. It's very suitable to be eaten after sunset while enjoying the cool night breeze.

The location is super duper strategic, from Sigura-gura near, from Galungung near, the point is the Malang city area. If you want to look for lodging near Warmindo, there is also a TS Guest House which can be reached by walking alone.

one of the places to eat in Malang that can really be for hanging out, doing assignments, or looking for mom, because the facilities are complete, starting from plugs, guitars, lesehan, and most importantly, Murce Yangy. the service is also good five stars, the toilets are clean and tidy, can pray too. fix, warmindo is the cutest in Malang!

warmindo is the most comfortable, cheap, has wifi, plugs, clean toilets, parking is also easy. Perfect for eating while hanging out at night. So keep on subscribing hahaha

Surprised to see the very spacious area of this cafe. I like their cozy setting, plenty of seating options, and the playlist, wifi, and electrical socket are suitable to do some work.

Price is very affordable, and their matcha tastes quite good.

However, the food menu is limited and most of them are stored cold (they just reheat them when we order). Also, the bathroom is only available on the first floor.

Nice cafe with great ambience. Not too crowded so it's suitable for studying. The food is average but the tea is delicious. Definitely will go back here. The place is quite hidden, in the 2nd floor of a building.

It is located on the second floor of Wikacell on Soekarno Hatta street. It's a cozy place to work, study, or just hangout with friends. Menus are varied and reasonably priced. There is a toilet on the first floor and a prayer room on the third floor. Overall this cafe is very comfortable.

This place only serves drinks, mainly coffee based, and snacks. They offer lunch meals which you can't choose what to eat, they only cook one menu each day :D

IT'S A GOOD PLACE FOR HANGING & BUKBERING!! away from the hustle and bustle of the highway and all kinds of vehicles that usually pass. It's really across from the rice fields.

Kmrin bukber came here, it's really a recommendation, the food is cheap, it's a buffet too. Those who have are also friendly. A prayer room, bathroom, also a sink for washing hands are provided.

In my opinion, the most complete place to hang out, when you're bored you don't have to worry about karaoke, the wifi is fast, the food menu is also varied...
It's raining, this is how Korean noodles and lemon tea match...

The place is ok, especially when it's quiet... it feels like hanging out on the roof top alone, you can see below there is a tomb with rice fields if it's not cloudy anymore and green rice fields are cool, isn't it?

couple month ago my frend tell me about coffe he bring from this shop and say ""the taste is nice and intruguing"" ..so today i visited this shop.. and ""yes"" it was..and ""more""..
this.. i think is proper benchmarks about coffe shop, not just coffe and place for hang around,  this place give proper combination about mood, vintage place, vintage coffe, proper serving attitude,  proper  knowledge, proper chat until hit your levels of coffe geeky-ness.
i stand to say this ""don't let your mind limited your curiosity just because intimidating aura of atmosphere"", the serving attitude in this place just sublime, is proper and nice to everyone..today i came with parfume ""reek de sweat"" and they just serving me with nice, good, kind of servings
so.... 10/10 stars for coffe shop , and serving attitude 20/10.

Iconic coffee place in the heritage area of kajoetangan.

It's on the main road with busy traffic.

Coffee was good, we tried the signature one.

Food (we tried bakwan) also good.

Prices is affordable lah, it's depends on your pocket ü§£.

Staff were nice and friendly.

I visited for lunch and did my work with friends. I experienced a delicious coffee with reasonable price and caring staff. The service was above average. The decor is a stunning with plants theme. I love the atmosphere and ambiance. This place has instagramable spot too. But I thing they need to improve the amount of toilet and the quality of Musholla. Overall this cafe left me an amazing experience and I can't wait to return. wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to hang out with friends.

Shoutout to the good taste of the playlist. Love it!

Beautiful place, with very friendly and helpful staff on duty. For foreigners do spray mosquito repellant first as this place decorated with potted plants and trees, expect to donate a few ounces of your blood.

Price is considered normal for a cafe, give them a try if you are looking for a place to relax and gather photo content.

If you are a coffee addict, I suggest that you order a hand brew, about 4 beans profile for you to choose from. My feedback is that they consider upgrading their espresso machine and grinder for better shots and milk frothing. Not a fair comment maybe cause I have high expectations over espresso base coffee.

A typical cafe with a greeny ambiance. Sad to see several broken tables full of ants. ‚òπÔ∏è

Outdoor vibes with a nice spot to take photos, cozy place for hangout or getting some me time"

H. Yusuf Jagung Bakar - a hangout place that is different from the others. This place has a mainstay menu of roasted corn and shaved corn.
The taste of the food provided varies, I personally like salted shaved corn. The place is quite spacious, can be used for hanging out dozens of people at once.
The downside of this place is that it doesn't provide wifi and sockets at every table.

Lots of hot snack menus. The roasted corn is okay. The ginger wedang lacks the taste of ginger, too much sugar. Spacious place, but not suitable for children

Pretty good. The combustion is uneven. It would be better if the combustion was evenly distributed over the entire surface. Reasonable"

I came here on the weekend and it is too crowded... Every table is placed too close from one another, I'm wondering if they correctly follow the pandemic protocol for cafe/restaurant (?) Especially the indoor dine-in area... isn't that too crowded? They should lessen the tables

The food is good

The pizza and the burger tastes nice. Staffs were kind of friendly. The location is quite nice as well although it's very small. The problem is that it took way too long for the food to come out. That's the thing that gives an illusion of this place being crowded at all times. Not because of they have a lot of customers, but because of slow service.

The place, for it's part of UB, is quite comfortable to hang out in. It has prayer room (musholla) and restroom available for the guests. I guess the menu has been changed since the first time I visited the place. I think, some food are somewhat pricey. The chicken salad is great, so is the tomyam soup. But the snacks are overpriced since they, in my opinion, are far from satisfying.

The kombucha is on point! the chicken is good but the sauce is just average.

its my first time came here. I came here with friends and order a drink and the same food for each of us.. They have a very slow service, our drink was served after 30ish minutes and the food were arrive after one (1) hour. We already go back and forth asking them and they always say that its because the rice is not ready. and we are not the only table waiting in such a loooong time like that.

It is very sad tho, they could learn something about supply chain management and communication between team to prevent this kind of issue.

The service is good, the cashier and one of the waiters are friendly and answer all our questions despite the crankyness we had (hungry due to waiting for an hour).

I like the chicken & kombuca here!

A small local restaurant/cafe with great service, food, drink and overall experience! They have a rooftop and oke bgt waktu senja2 dateng kesini!
Definitely a go-to place for cafe when you are in malang Huge portion of roasted chicken (which is tasty) & side dishes are delicious as well.

A lil bit shocked that malang has a place to drink kombucha in a market. Their kombucha is nice but i think if only they can make it more sweet. Price is not too pricey. Better come in the afternoon

Donuts were super fresh, soft but crispy! Goes well with our iced coffee. A nice place to chill or Do your work.

You should try their cheesecakeüòçüç∞!! It is surprisingly good and it‚Äôll only cost you IDR 15k! I also ordered their Coffee Latte which tasted ok, not bad, but didn‚Äôt really meet my expectation. I should try another drink for the next visit.

The place has a relaxed ambience, especially when it‚Äôs not too crowded. I sat on the ground floor (its a two story high building) and people around me were busy with their laptops, so I guess it‚Äôs a proper place for you to focus on your work here.

The baristas are friendly and kind, they will welcome you and say thank you before you leave the cafe. It‚Äôs kinda cute bc they do it all together, reminds me of how indom*ret greets their customers ü•∫

this time I will tell you about my experience and what I feel after visiting this cafe. The first time I visited this cafe with my junior high school friend in Malang, he to be the one who told me about this place. okay, at that time we visited this place at 10 pm, this place is still crowded, it just so happens that this cafe has 3 floors, the first floor is the cashier and also a few tables for visitors, then on the 2nd floor is an indoor room where this room is covered with glass, lots of tables and mostly used by students who want to do assignments. because on the 2nd floor there is no smoking allowed. so it is very comfortable to work in focus. on the 2nd floor there is also a toilet whose design is very futuristic and of course interesting. okay, because at that time I sat on the 3rd floor there was a lively atmosphere, lots of people hanging out with their friends because the rooftop on this floor allowed smoking, there is also a bar here and there are lots of tables on the 3rd floor, we can also see the city lights. and the service at this cafe is quite good, the employees are friendly, but because the place is very busy it makes them a bit of a hassle.

I just passed through Malang and so happen got tired and get some rest here. The cappucino was meh, it taste like instant coffee. The ice cream was nice, I buy kopyor ice cream and it's decent for 15RB price. Not so sweet just as I like it. The place was spacious. Lot's of collage students there getting some work done. Pretty cheap and cozy fast internet and clean. I went to 3rd floor and since Malang is kinda cold that day it's really nice. Overall 7/10. Maybe after taste some dishes I could increase it. Maybe next time

Cheap food and coffee, wide and comfy, dont use 3rd floor if it sunny.. too hot. Okay when at night

WOW is one of the cafes located in Malng City. With a very aesthetic location and suitable for doing tasks because of its convenient and cool location.
There is also live music so we don't get bored to hang out there. However , the prices there do not match student friendly , students and even boarding children like me with drinks priced above 20,000 Because I think it's expensive.
However, the menu is not boring. The special menu at WARUNK WOW KWB is Rice Bowl, Indomie, Roti Bakar (Rotkar), Coffee which is famous as a cheap menu with priced under 20.000 . But with a modern and luxurious presentation."

Nice industrial vibes and nice grounded coffee blend

One of the cafes in Suhat is located next to the Sahid Montana hotel.  This cafe is not too wide but very homey.  The table provided is enough for groups and alone.  The menu offered is interesting, tastes good and has many choices.  Chocolate and coffee based drinks are highly recommended.  For snacks I recommend churros and fries.  One thing that is a little annoying for me personally, sometimes too many people smoke, so the smoke gathers until the table and my clothes smell of cigarette smoke, for passive smokers like me, it's quite disturbing.  Maybe there needs to be another way and regulation to handle my complaint.  thanks.

First of all, nice interior concept, just like an old gold mining site. I drank their coldbrew and it tastes great, mild and fruity. Next time I'll go there, I'd love to enjoy my coldbrew without an ice cube, it might taste a lot better. Overall, as a newcomers, they offer a great Australian culture coffeeshop. You should go there.

Have been trying their several different menus and here's my top three so far:
1. Iced hojicha; it's creamy and thick, the flavour is quite deep, not overly sweetÔºçjust a perfect bittersweet combination
2. French fries with this yellow sauce and mozzarella (I forgot the actual name in the menu üòÇ); because cheese will never be wrong!
3. Beef kebab; the sauce is exceptional!

Unfortunately, I can't give any review about their coffee because tbh my body cannot 'cooperate' at all with any coffee intake, but I can still say this is a nice place to spend the time. The place is not really wide but it's super cozy and calming„Éºsuch a perfect workspace. Not too crowded but it's not empty either. Staffs and owner are very humble and friendly, and they will explain anything if you ask them about the menu. I had a really good time here, and I won't be hesitating to visit this place again and try their other menus!"

Yesterday there was an opening promo buy one get one free until March 5 2020. For the taste, this coffee is definitely delicious. Very good service and also very fast.

The place is so comfy, especially for doing some work or task with your laptop (WiFi is available here).

I ordered ice milk coffee called Pasti Kopi Susu and it turned out good.

Surprisingly at this nylempit place you can find  a cozy place to hang with your friends or just doing your stuff on laptop.

The coffee they serve is quite interesting. You can find es kopi susu with brown sugar here. Si refreshing!

Their accident coffee (maksudnya kopi tubruk) is quite strong. Its aroma is very good.

Lots of interesting drinks. Coffee, tea, or.. me? üòúüòú

But the camilans they serve is rather limited. Their cinnamon roll bun is quite nice. You can cokot it than use fork or spoon.

I like their interior design. Especially at evening. You can get beautiful selfie-selfie here.

Nice place.

And very helpful and friendly owner.

Well I think this place is pretty much great except for the fact that the air conditioner is not working. It was a rainy afternoon, I needed place for my homework and I remembered my friend told me about this place a long time ago. They have small room and limited table which is fine to me, but with limited air circulation I am getting sweaty and sweaty then I decided to leave. Fix the air conditioner and perhaps I‚Äôll go there again someday.

Even though its location takes more effort to reach from the main street, you'll be glad to discover some of their finest beverages... especially coffee. I personally choose their ""Pasti Kopi Susu"" as it suits my taste so well, it has a gentle flavor which is hard to describe here, so just find out yourself. The atmosphere of this place is great, many good spot to take beauty shot or a perfect selfie for your social media needs. I love their fast wifi connection and calm indie music playing in the background. Both barista are also cheerful and definitely the person you'll be willing to tell your story with.

Good place for work on your laptop, the room is small, their coffee tasted good"

The interior is simple yet tells a story of life in the past. Totally love the concept. It is also comfortable and peaceful to work on your laptop here.

The foods and drinks are also quite nice. Glad I tried this place. Definitely will come back to reminisce this place.

Give Kopituju a visit and you will see how this place stands out among the rest of the buildings. Going inside, the ambiance is humble but welcoming. Coffee was simply satisfying, one of the best in town. In general, this cafe feels like an oasis in the hustle and bustle of Malang, where you can escape for a caffeine fix.

Best coffee in Malang (in my opinion), and their burnt basque cheese cake, is the best I have ever tried.

crueller nya so good! coffee nya juga but a bit pricey. definitely will go back to try other baked goods.

Cafe Located in the courtyard of the Harris Malang hotel. The atmosphere is comfortable, shady and quite calm. Suitable for relaxing for a while. Open to the public, without having to stay at the Harris Hotel. The cafe area carries a semi-outdoor theme, with plants that are shady and comfortable to live in when it's hot. The menu choices are quite varied, from coffee to frappe. For very limited food choices, I had time to try boiled instant noodles which was quite disappointing, because it was really just boiled noodles and eggs. For a class of contemporary cafes, the food presentation is very standard with the prices offered. The staff is friendly, and very helpful. Overall this cafe is comfortable, but needs some input for the menu offered.

Nice and calm atmosphere, the coffee is also good, the barista gives input according to what I want. The best chocolate! My kids love chocolate and cookies & cream. The family is very happy to see the many lights. Very good"

Hidden gem that are not too busy, with carefully crafted menus.

Nice place, aesthetic in all parts indoor & outdoor, for drink I like sigurih the most. When I went there, it was cloudy and then after a while it started to rain. While the indoor area is not that wide, so there are some visitors who take shelter outside, I suggest it would be even better if the indoor area was expanded.

Also, when I ordered a cheese cake, the cashier said it was available, so I paid for it, but after a while she said it was sold out. Finally I ordered another cake and the cashier said the change would be given to me later but she didn't give it to me until I finally asked for it myself as I was planning to leave.

So please improve the service again, and hopefully it will get even better on my next visit, but overall this is a great place üòÖüåø‚òï

Lowokwaru, Kota Malang, Jawa Timur 65144, Indonesia","cafe, food, point_of_interest, store, establishment",4.4,619,1,"This cafe is located in Merjosari, to be precise, next to the Merjosari park alley, Malang City. I went to this place because I got together with my friends with scholarships from UIN, UM, and UB to discuss work programs. Here not only serves various kinds of drinks and snacks but also facilitates reading books, visitors who come can spend their time enjoying the meal while reading the books that are neatly arranged on the shelves. In my opinion, the service is pretty good, the taste of the drinks is also pretty good, and the prices are also right from 8 thousand to 20 thousand, it's just that in my opinion the place is not comfortable. The chairs were not neatly arranged after being occupied by other people and the table still had traces of the drink from the previous visitor.

This coffee shop is so well-known arround the students in Malang because this place's included as the most productive coffee shops for discussion and another agendas. It's also commonly called as Gusdurian (a group of people who follow the value of Gus Dur, 4th President of Indonesia) basecamp and also the place for meeting and discussion by another communities tho. There are many books in the first floor, and it's actually has 3 floors. This place is not only sold the coffee, but also tea, milk, hot chocolate and so on.

this place live up to its name. it provides light drinks, coffee, and small snacks. there's a decent public library, means you don't need to worry if you forgot to bring your books. wifi are also available if you're in for some productivity tasks. parking is not shaded and it's on the side of the street directly. may not suitable for dating, but best for group discussion.

EDIT: several days ago I went back and found out if you want to do events here you need to secure mininum purchase of several hundred thousand rupiahs. If you cannot do that, they charge you additional money. But not all the menus are available for us to purchase. Most of them are sold out, but they don't care if we couldn't reach the mark, we still need to pay the money. How could we fulfill their minimum purchase, if we cannot order anything? I lowered my points from 4 to 2. Still a good place, but not recommended for meeting.

I went here for a casual meeting with my friend. They ran out of the snack and meals. I could ordered iced taro only. The price was cheap. I was surprised the photo in the Google maps didn't match the reality. The place was kinda dirty. They might haven't mopped the floor for a really long time. There were thick layer of dust above the books on the shelf. I was having my drink in the rooftop. The rooftop was dirty and kinda dark. There were only one or two light bulbs. The toilet was in the second story, it was really smelly and disgusting. Poorly maintained place.

It's really nice to hang out here actually, especially if you host a discussion event or simply want to meet people and talk upon some issues in depth. For this oase cafe regulars are activists and intellectuals.

I was hosting a discussion event inviting some groups several days ago. The management charges us 210k rupiah for minimum purchase.

What really disappoint me is:
1) they didnt explain that there will be minimum purchase before the d-day
2) I was and am really okay with the minimum purchase, it's small amount of money. I was really sure the crowd will exceed the minimum purchase by ordering several drinks and food. BUT THEY ONLY SERVED DRINKS. THE MEALS ON THEIR MENU WERE NOT AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT YET THEY STILL INSIST FOR US MAKING IT TO MINIMUM PURCHASE
(how could you expect your customer to order a bag of air or a plate of disappointment and inconvenient and swearing never come back there again smh)
3) They even didn't let us start our event until we make it to minimum purchase. I do understand that your company pushed you hard to meet our obligation as client, sir. But please: you should have informed me before the d-day and providing solving to the situation too!
4) I was complaining to the management after the event finished, they told me that IF I DIDNT MAKE THE MINIMUM PURCHASE, I HAD TO GIVE THEM THE SPARE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CHARGED US.
Excuse you, sir, but your company fail to cater us the food you promised to serve. And you expect us to get our money for bags of air and plates of disappointment. Thank you.
5) We did make it to the minimum purchase. Although I had to pay for some orders they served wrong.

It is never about the amount of money for me. It is the hospitality this caf√© fail to provide. I have charged for bigger amounts of money at another caf√© and I was really happy. Definitely will not come back."

It's hot, at night and the ac are not on, cant even open the windows.

A good place to eat with your family and friends, they have a lot of seats, the price is cheap for each meatball, and they have some set menu so the total price will be cheaper

Klojen, Kota Malang, Jawa Timur 65116, Indonesia","cafe, store, restaurant, point_of_interest, food, establishment",4.5,77,,"The location is easy to find, just several meters from the gate of Ijen Nirwana Residence. Well, this place is not so spacious though. It's rather small for a cafe located downtown. But as long as you come at the right hours where the crowd is considerably minimum, then you will get a nice ambience instead. Meanwhile, as usual, I tried their latte. It was good enough. But their platter which consists of fried broccoli, kind of mushroom, potatl wedges and fried tofu was incredible. It's tasty and the sauce has some kind of unique sweet taste.

Visit this place after it got promoted by a local IG food reviewer. Nothing's special about this coffeeshop. Price are a bit expensive for that size of coffee. Dish needs forever to be served. Can't find a non-smoking table, unless those one outside.

I like the ambience, the drinks are great. I ordered strawberry creamy and ice coffee mantra. The strawberry creamy is basically like strawberry milk with the exact sweetness based on my likes. The ice coffee mantra, which is specialty in this cafe, but I think isn't special because the taste is like basic ice coffee milk *imo*.
The place is great for hang out with your friends, but not really great for those of you who want to be alone, because it's pretty crowded.

Location: 5/5 (easy to find.)
Place: 3/5 (great interior, I like the wall painting and painting in a frame, very creative. But I think, the cafe should put more ventilation, because sometimes customers are smoke in the indoor room. I found it pretty stuffy for indoor room)
Price: 4/5 (affordable prices according to the quality of the food)

Aesthetic place with limited menu to choose. Food is fair-priced considering the quantity and taste. Air circulation is problematic if you sit inside in a humid, hot weather and smoking area is basically everywhere. Waiter, cook, and barista are all very welcoming. Worth the visit with group of friends, but not intimate place for couples.

Nice place with good food"

1. The place is rather small than the other two (maxx and sbux) they only have five tables indoor area and two or three tables outside.
2. Ordered a choco drink (forget the name) and a chicken panini. Taste wise, pretty good and simple, nothing breakthrough tho. Might ordered something else later.

DISH
the food is delicious, the mentai sauce is real with tobiko, the blackpepper sauce is also very flavorful with the black pepper so it's not just sweet. The drink is also great, the chocolate ice is really nyoklat, not too sweet. But at night, the hot tea is the best, one pot and the black pepper rice bowl.

LIVE MUSIC
then certain days there is live music, it's really cool outdoor semi outdoor looking green while listening to music.

very good, especially the price is very cheap, drinks 10-20 thousand, snacks 12 thousand, food 20 thousand. On gofood/grabfood/shopeefood there is usually a promo too

The concept is elegant. Friendly service. Clean. Prices are quite cheap. The cheese cake is delicious. The inside space is narrow, just the two of you come.

My personal favorite coffee shop in Malang.
The food and drinks I‚Äôve ordered always taste right on my buds.

I fell in love with the place thanks to the sofas area on the 2nd floor. They look a lot like a family restaurant in the west lol! It‚Äôs cute and private. The WiFi is fast and consistent, so you definitely can study, work, or just enjoy your netflix comfortably. I always visited the place in the morning till afternoon so far, and it‚Äôs never been too crowded. Perhaps because I haven‚Äôt stop by at its peak hour.

They accept ovo as well which is good.

It's a two-story cafe so the place is quite spacious. The theme for the 1st and 2nd floor is different, the 1st floor interior looks like a common yet comfy interior you'd find in any typical cafe. The 2nd floor looks like a family dinner place, the other section looks like casual-colorful themed, the terrace is woody-themed [?]

Their drink tastes alright and the pricing is no different than other caf√©s (around IDR 20K and up). We bought a toast and mozzarella stick, hmm... the taste and presentation can be improved.

There's a lot of seating arranged for small to large group. We went there around 8 PM and sat on the 2nd floor terrace. I tell you it's not the best place to enjoy the night. Although the cafe itself located in a strategic place with good parking space, the road is way too busy and noisy for you to hold a proper conversation without raising your voice. Even though the 1st floor music sounds a bit louder, I suppose it's better that way because you'd hear less noise from the busy road."

They claimed ""kopi giras"" as their specialty coffee, which I suspect was a variety of Javanese robusta. Other warkop drinks such as iced coffee and other sweet drinks are also available.

They also served nice condiment: deep fried tempe tepung which tastes good together with the petis. On top of that, the price range is really cheap! They open 24 hours and have a lot of electric terminal in case you need to charge your phone (I believe it's a popular spot to play MOBA with your team because of this).

It can be chocolate granules, fruit, jelly, colorful candies and chocolate milk which makes the ice cream just unique

Stopped by to buy local ground coffee for souvenirs. (They had few single origin options: Aceh Gayo, Toraja, Dampit & Java Ijen)

Heard it‚Äôs legendary.

Price is very affordable and transaction is quick.

Stop by kopituju next door before leaving

A nice place to stop by and grab some afternoon cofee. Very affordable menus as it is situated within the Universitas Brawijaya's campus, where it is becoming very popular among them. They have a good choice of local coffee, as well as various refreshments and good meals. I have ordered a plate of hotdog and the veggies freshness truly amazed me off. Good for group, good for self, but just remember to avoid the rush hour.

Located on Brawijaya campus, but not only for students.
Perfect place to study or chill, with an amazing quality of coffee.
Lunch and dinner is also possible, a little bit european style, as well as local dishes.

Definitely recommended!

On the picture, you can see a grill chicken ceasar salad, prepared with less fat and souce on the side!

The place, for it's part of UB, is quite comfortable to hang out in. It has prayer room (musholla) and restroom available for the guests. I guess the menu has been changed since the first time I visited the place. I think, some food are somewhat pricey. The chicken salad is great, so is the tomyam soup. But the snacks are overpriced since they, in my opinion, are far from satisfying.

Nice coffee , comfort place...located inside brawijaya university.. in front of KPRI brawijaya.. they has many kind of coffee.. which came from their own farm.. coffee plantation growth in University Brawijaya research forest. The baristas should giving story about their great coffees.."

Best place and view thank for good service ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Good

Actually in terms of location, this cafe already has advantages & wins a lot. But seen from several other sides there are a number of things that are a minus value.

The positives: the location is very strategic, in the heart of the city / main wooden protocol road, access & parking right on the edge of the main road. From here, it's easy to go anywhere & surrounded by complete public facilities (ATMs, shops, etc.).

What is inconvenient: access from the 1st floor to the 3rd floor which is steep & not recommended for the elderly & children, even teenagers have to be careful so they don't slip, especially while carrying trays of coffee & snacks. The view of the city from the balcony is also not optimal because it is blocked by cables & electricity poles which are very crowded.

For variations in the price of drinks & snacks, it's not bad for a cafe in the city center area, even though it's still a bit burdensome for school children's pockets. Btw, the delicious cheese bread makes you full & the chocolate ice is fresh.
Maybe that's all for now... hopefully in the future it will be even better 24/12/22

One of the cafes located in the Kayutangan heritage area. The place is small but has 4 floors. Cozy enough to hang out.

The menu is quite diverse for a cafe. Try the gelato, it's pretty good. But the price is a bit pricey compared to other cafes in Malang."

Cheap price for european food, you can get meal for two person under 100 thousand rupiah but unfortunately it tasted too salty & oily. The worst of all was it is very very noisy. It seems that this restaurant is a dormitory for highschool student, so theres a lot teenager sit in here while playing online games Mobile Legends. They talk with very loud voices & scream a lot. Extremely annoying

Nothing beats the taste of homemade pasta! Great Italian flavours, great price with international taste! Not only that, the chef himself greeted us with love. Totally feels like home. Best! I totally recommend this to you and my Jakarta friends!

A definite place to visit if you go to Malang. Survive among the rise of online food. It hasn't changed at all since ten years ago when I first went there. A place full of memories.

When I was in college, we often gathered here, waiting for class time while drinking juice. Mango melon juice was delicious.

Service is top notch, place is cozy, not too crowded, song playlist is also great. Food is good (chicken quesadillas and their Japanese salad are must-have). Will come back often!

It‚Äôs really nice and cozy cafe with tropical ambience, you‚Äôll feel in Bali once you step in their gate. All the food and drinks that I ordered was good with fast service.

Bit pricy maybe for the city but yes it's worth a fine dining experience ! Taste so delicious and yet plating was awesome!! Quiet for meeting  or dating ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©very recommended . 2 tumb for the chef !!

I went here twice. The first time I went with my sister. We ordered Horenso salad. It was so good, especially the sauce. It was sour, sweet and something that I can't describe. Also the veggies was so fresh.
I also ordered Chicken steak (for me, it was regular chicken steak) but the sauce was yummy and chicken pop. I am not recommended chicken pop. It was hard. Then, for drink I ordered Green Republic. I like it.
The second time ordered Chicken Fajitas. I think they have specialty in sauce. Again, the sauce was superb. I want more the sauceü•≤.
Last but not least was coffee latte. I don't like it. Just like reguler coffe latte that I made in home.
I didn't see if they have baby chair. Maybe you can asked them if you plan with your baby. I saw prayer place for Muslim and the toilet was cleaned.

If you have plan to Fertisoil I recommend the salad and Chicken Fajitas or something that has sauce. They have special sauces in their menu.

i feel like the price is kinda pricey for a cafe in malang. but i like their egg croissant sandwich! that's good. another well designed cafe in malang, i like their minimalistic concept. even though their place is kinda small, but they have non smoking and smoking area, they even have outdoor area. thinking of coming back someday!"

In fact its location is in the middle of a village. You need to be very meticulous to find it. The house seems to be an old one, the one that hasn't gone through much renov. It is left almost as its original form. The furnishings are also vintage. The owner or the barrista, I am not sure which, is very friendly young man. I bought its signature, called Iced-Coffee Kane (delicious Iced-Coffee), which is creamy and strong.

One of the small local coffeeshop that makes me impressed. It's because their signature coffee taste differ from another coffeeshop in Malang. They are not only following the trend, but they pay attention to their quality. My favorite is Es Kopi Susu Kane, paired it with a freshly homemade donut. You have to try it.

'Drink coffee at home' is the concept of this place. Built in the barista/owner's own house, the ambience feels so homey, reminds me of my grandpa's home back in my hometown somehow. But still has a little touch of coffeeshop with a small bar in the corner. Has lots of coffee beans, from arabika to robusta. Tried their filtered tolu batak, latte, and es susu kopi (ice coffee milk), tasted good, made with manual machine. For a non coffee drinker, try the Galauincinno ice, their special recipe, a beverage made of milk, coffee, ice, and palm sugar! A unique one, but taste really good! Affordable price, from 5k to 20k.

You will never expect a coffee shop at a quite place like this, is really traditionally and vintage place with many kind of arabica and robusta coffee, you will be spoiled by the whole coffee things

Es Kopi Kane from this coffee shop has special and unique taste. Pricing is standard. Available for take away and delivery service from food delivery app."

The place is okay, comfortable, suitable for young people to hang out. A variety of menus are served, starting from a fried rice menu, egg salad, to drinks such as tubruk kobi and matcha latte in the cafe.

Finally, I can taste Lampung Robusta Coffee and Lintong Arabica. it's boring, the problem is that Ijen always closes everywhere

Nice cafe, the coffee menu is pretty good at affordable prices. You can also buy coffee beans if you want to grind yourself at home. Like the lemon tea. If you are hungry while hanging out, here they also provide heavy menus such as crispy chicken steak, fresh vegetables and fried rice. Price? Affordable for students. I ordered a crispy chicken steak for only 16 thousand and got a more filling portion than the usual steak stalls. The chicken fried rice is also not bad, with 15 thousand you can already get Portugal (digger's portion) plus eggs and crackers, but the chicken steak is really a winner.

We looking forward to try the almond croissant but unfortunately it already sold out. So we try strawberry danish and meat pie, which pretty decent but still not what we expect from the lot of good reviews written. Personally, prefer the pastry to be more flaky and the filling both sweet or savour more balanced. Place is indeed pretty picturesque if you like to take a photo but not that much place for dine in. I recommend to come in the morning if you want to try all their selection and want to dine in.

My fave pastry place! They have various options of pastry, super tasty with affordable price. The place is cozy and instagramable, it‚Äôs a nice place for hangout in the afternoon or after office time. Unfortunately the coffee isn‚Äôt so good. And sometimes most of the bestseller items are sold out, but they usually restock it again at noon. If you want to try their various or bestseller items i suggest to come around 9-11am. But i still love this place, everything beside the coffee is nice, the pastries, the place, the staff even the parking man is friendly n has a good manner!

Reallyyy super delicious. The croissant is not too expensive. The original croissant priced for 16k only. But beware of the queue because it can be an hour long of wait or more. Place is cute too with the red themed decoration."

A friend recommended Awal Bermula Cafe and Eatery. At first I did not have much expectation, but after my visit I can say that it is a perfect spot to hang-out with friends, work on your computer or simply enjoy a plate of snack and drink.
Even though Awal Bermula is located on a busy street, across Pasar Blimbing, once you are inside, it is quiet. Their food and drink were okay (between 20-30K). It also has some seatings on the 2nd floor.
One major turn-off is parking. Parking space is tiny, fit two cars and two/three motorcycles or six motorcycles. Take ride-hailing service will save you from headache.

The beverages is good, the vibe in such a place is amazing for a dinner and chill time. Customer can enjoy the view from above to the road

I tried the beans that won 3rd place in world championship and also magic that use competition milk. But since they have some interesting appetizer menus, I also tried nachos. Overall imo, coffees are quite good with affordable price for such experience and histories. Nachos were very good too, but the combination with coffee were not working well. Ambience is good too for hangout or work. Worth to try and will come back again.

This place is great for you who wanna spend some quality time with friends while enjoying good costly dishes and drinks. They serve selections of signature coffee. I tried their Vegan Fuel something, consisting of soy milk, espresso and sugar. I actually loved it. For the food, I ordered their beef blackpepper rice. To me, it's just fine.
Unfortunately, since there was no indoor seating available, we had to pick outdoor tribune to enjoy our orders and it wasn't a nice experience. The weather was windy and a bit chilly, so you can imagine how uncomfortable it is. Plus, the tribune is not suitable for eating something served on a plate.

Went here for brunch and it was very perfect, the place was great, every single spot is absolutely instagram worthy.

Various menu from snacks, desserts and drinks and they're all so pretty and yummy. the cafe owner is very friendly to his customer.

The parking area is so wide. Once I enter the coffee shop, the waitress offered me to sit in the indoor area with sofa because she saw me with a baby. It has online order system with e-payment, but don't worry we can still pay with cash.
It's so comfortable because it also has praying room which is so clean.

Complete package. Nice place just to hang or dine in. Good food, awesome coffee.
The basic ice americano with fruity beans, not my personal preference but still, great!
The white butter rum by far is favorite. Price is reasonable too.
Good job!"

They have tropical-industrial decoration, really like cafes in Canggu, and the coconut tree there really fits with the vibe. They sell mainly non-alcoholic drinks, but they provide cold beers as well. Kinda pricey if it's compared with any other cafe in Malang, but still reasonable. Definitely a must visit if you have an occasion in Malang.

One of the coffee places that is thick with the local wisdom of the city of Malang. This place has been passed down for generations to generations of brewed coffee lovers. The menu choices are not adventurous. Black Coffee, Milk Coffee, Ginger Coffee and Tea. Some militant customers here sometimes refer to it as Kopi Hitam as Kopi Lanang, and Kopi Wedok as Kopi Susu.
For friends enjoying coffee, various traditional snacks are served such as brontak tofu, fried bananas, tempe mendoan, and gandos that will add to the enjoyment of your coffee.

Atmosphere ok strategic lovation but sometimes too noisy due to semi open air and the traffic but the menu, taste and variety are good

A great place to hang out with friends and family! Food and beverages vary, the price range from 20-50 thousand rupiah. At that time I ate fish and chips and green tea, it tastes good and quite filling. Because it is located at a crossroads, so the view is pretty good. There was live music too until about 11pm, and it was very entertaining.

The place is nice, cozy, and clean. The menus are affordable and taste really good, although it may take some time (30-45 minutes) per menu to be served. It's a good place for having online work/class, or even family gatherings

Nice place to havr a dinner..they offer some kind of traditional food and drinks.. i ordered Jahe kencur gula merah, alang2 tea with rosella, rawon blonceng and noodle. Im so happy to find they serve the drinks with the real herbs fulfilling the glass..looks so authentic and traditional..i like the alang2tea with rosella at the most, the scent and taste is so refreshing and healty feels..

Nice ambience. Good food & coffee. Fair price

3 stars is too low but for 5 stars...Bhava definitely needs to work a lot more.

Having passed this place several times, I finally stepped in it last night.

Being seen from the road, Bhava seems cramped. In fact, it is a roomy corridor with warm lighting and nice match of colors. An array of 12 semi-industrial style table sets are neatly placed to accommodate couples or families indoor as well as 3 set for those who love it outdoor.

Having not so many items in the menu represents Bhava's dedication to the food taste and quality for customers' satisfaction.
Their food, indeed, indulge our tastebud surprisingly.

Yet, I have to be honest; serving speed is Bhava's weak point. While only one other table occupied by customers, a 30-minute wait for one of 4 meals in the order to appear is never good enough. If 4 of the tables are occupied by families simultaneously, the last to submit order may have to watch an empty table for 2 hours with growling tummy.
I believe this place can come up with better work rythm to compose more melodic eating experience.

Nice place to hang out with friends and families. Good coffee, good food.

The staffs were friendly, quick. The place, of course is the main attraction here. But the drinks were nothing special that prices around 25-29k. the mushroom pizza was fine tho. french fries is just like the regular french fries in some other restos, which fast food branches still taste better.

I came here on the weekend and it is too crowded... Every table is placed too close from one another, I'm wondering if they correctly follow the pandemic protocol for cafe/restaurant (?) Especially the indoor dine-in area... isn't that too crowded? They should lessen the tables

The food is good
The staffs, especially the security is sooooo friendly and helpful ‚ô°

The pizza and the burger tastes nice. Staffs were kind of friendly. The location is quite nice as well although it's very small. The problem is that it took way too long for the food to come out. That's the thing that gives an illusion of this place being crowded at all times. Not because of they have a lot of customers, but because of slow service.

The first time to Kopi Titik Koma in Tidar. The atmosphere is really good for coffee or working alone and makes you feel at home. Moreover, the staff is also friendly and super help full.

There is a prayer room and the toilets are also clean, so for those who want WFC here it's really good. It's a shame that the toilet is a bit problematic because the spray section for wiping water only comes out a little. Hopefully it can be fixed asap.

Cozy enough for wfc alone or with friends. Each table does have a plug but only 1, so if you want to use it for a crowd you have to bring your own coiled cable. Wifi is quite smooth. Semicolon standard coffee menu and prices. Worth it for occasional try"

The place, ambiance, food and drinks were good.
The kombucha is on point! the chicken is good but the sauce is just average.

its my first time came here. I came here with friends and order a drink and the same food for each of us.. They have a very slow service, our drink was served after 30ish minutes and the food were arrive after one (1) hour. We already go back and forth asking them and they always say that its because the rice is not ready. and we are not the only table waiting in such a loooong time like that.

It is very sad tho, they could learn something about supply chain management and communication between team to prevent this kind of issue.

The service is good, the cashier and one of the waiters are friendly and answer all our questions despite the crankyness we had (hungry due to waiting for an hour).

I like the chicken & kombuca here!

A small local restaurant/cafe with great service, food, drink and overall experience! They have a rooftop and oke bgt waktu senja2 dateng kesini!
Definitely a go-to place for cafe when you are in malang Huge portion of roasted chicken (which is tasty) & side dishes are delicious as well.

A lil bit shocked that malang has a place to drink kombucha in a market. Their kombucha is nice but i think if only they can make it more sweet. Price is not too pricey. Better come in the afternoon

First time coming here and I wasn‚Äôt impressed with what they offered on paper. Or perhaps because I‚Äôve spent considerable amount of emotional cost just to find the location. It was barely visible from the busy street on that Saturday night. However, it only took one bite to calibrate my frustrated mind cause the food was fantastic. My brother and I tried three dishes and my entire mouth was gladly participating. Chicken was tender. Beef was tender and super moist. Seasoning was on point. I don‚Äôt know about the rest of the menu tho. I‚Äôll come back later.

I have no complaint for anything about the food. It taste good, fair portion for the price. Waiters are all giving their best service. I just not really enjoy the ambience. I don't get the concept. It's too formal to be a cafe, but it's too loud and casual to be a fine dining place. I hope they could work this out, because i love their Nasi Seafood Siram Woku and looking forward to have another dine in.

Good food, big portion, and clean place. Although the price is expensive, the taste and the portion are worthed. The service is very welcome. I can say ""it is one of the best restaurant in Malang"".

Good food, even I can say the price is so cheap for delicious and  cool plating ..

The food is okay (although it was served not quite warm) but the service is very bad. First, you have to wait a long time for your food. Secondly, I don't understand why tourists have to pay in advance when Indonesians can pay just like in any decent restaurant, after eating a meal, just before leaving.
I don't really know what the reason is, is it racism against white people?
If you are trying to copy European/American standards then improve your customer service because unfortunately you don't have much chance to attract more customers with this behavior.
It's a pity because you could have found yourself in a large guide about Indonesia and now you will become viral on TikTok.
Unfortunately, you are the worst restaurant we ate at during our Southeast Asia trip."

A shop that provides menus with different flavors. The menu here has fried rice, fried noodles, etc. It's just that what makes it special is how to cook it using a charcoal stove, so it tastes better. If you come here, you must try the anchovy fried rice and anchovy fried noodles, highly recommended. Unfortunately the parking space here is not wide enough, so it's confusing if you take a car for example.

Not bad for treating the feeling of longing for nasgor areng from kediri. It's similar to Nasigor on Jalan Doho, Kediri, pretty good. The price is also cheap starting from 10 thousand. Try it

Nice vibes

Found this warkop by accident when passing through Cor Jesu. It turns out to be a humble and nice place to chat. There are several types of drinks and the prices are still affordable. Plus on weekends you can have morning coffee here, interesting!

If by chance it's late and you are looking for a place to drink coffee or tea, you can come here, especially after the rain it is suitable to cover and drink warm drinks here.

For the drinks themselves, there is coffee, and quite a wide selection of teas. I personally think the selection of teas is quite unique and worth trying all of them. I tried the milk tea myself and it's quite suitable for the taste, maybe next time I'll ask for the level of sweetness to be reduced. Then had time to try the lemon grass eggplant. Unique, warm, and fresh, that's the description. Perfect for accompanying the evenings after the rain.

For food there are some snacks that can accompany your cup of coffee or tea, please check what's available.

As for the seats themselves on the side of the road around this warkop area, there are quite a lot of chairs, so don't worry about not getting a place. Likewise, the parking area is also wide and guarded by parking officers, safe.

The coffeeshop itself is only a building for the bar area. And in my opinion, the arrangement is really neat, starting from the decoration with retro items, then the arrangement of the tea jars and tools is neat, it's nice to see. It also makes you feel at home looking at the bar and then seeing the crowd around. Accompanied by the sound of the street. The point is serene.

Overall a fun place, always happy to stop by a place like this. Immediately put it on the list of warkop that are worth going to!

Many menu choices. Drinks and snacks.

Strategic location and friendly service. Affordable prices. That's fine...

It's a good place to go, it's so good ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫"

The cashier was somehow hostile toward customers; when you work providing this type of services, you're supposed to be 'approachable', easy to talk to. The man who was serving the coffee and tea, the barista, or I assume was the owner of the place, was a lot friendlier. Go here if you're looking for a 'hidden gem' cafe that has the soothing and greeny vibes because the music wasn't too loud and it has lots of plants, plus the location is quite distant from the main street.

Oh wow, what a hidden gem I found here in Malang.
I love their concept, it felt like you're visiting your frineds house and hanging out at their garden. The place is not crowded, the vibes are chill and the drinks are great. They provide a great coffee beans here, and the capucino were great! my fave!,
I tried some of their snacks as well, and Inlike the avocados one, surprisingly good, but I think they could only served several sets per day.

would def come back again (hopefully regulary)

‚ÄúHidden Gem‚Äù in Malang that Must-Visit for the one who loves Speciality Coffee and for those who loves to explore n appreciate good vibesüòÅ. An amazing experience I had with the owner, very warm-welcoming, friendly n humble person. Very good vibes place. Amazing coffee n lots of selections of coffee, tea, snacks. $-$$$. Amazing place to do meetings, WFA, and to unwind.

This experience, ordered the Arabica Bajawa Espresso + Cafe Latte
Also the Leuchtfeuer Coffee Costa Rica for the manual brew

Thank you for the experience and best wishes for Roewang Tamoe Coffee

Not exactly sure what is the hype, I know this place from social media and when I was there, sure the coffee is quite good. There are some bread and pastries which seems good.

The one that got my bad side was, since this place is in residential area there were some snack vendors going around the block. When I tried to buy snack from vendor (the coffee shop didnt have this snack and I was still buying their coffee and snacks) they straight up forbid me. I understand there is a ""no food from outside"" rule, but there were no other costomer inside and I always clean up before myself.

Homey coffee shop with retro vibes interior design. Served great coffee. Wanna comeback for sure."

But not with their interior design, so similar with Starbucks. Let's say it's a local Starbucks. It feels like they don't have their own characteristics. Still better for me, since they have excellent staff and their coffee is superb!

After exploring many coffee shops, I found one coffee shop which I think is really worth it for students like us to visit üòÄ.  Nakoa cafe Bondowoso is one of my favorite hangout cafes, it seems I have visited this cafe countless times.  The reason why Nakoa is my favorite cafe is that most of the people who come here are students doing their assignments, so it makes the atmosphere of the cafe calm and not chaotic.  The people at Nakoa also don't care about visitors, so I think Nakoa is really good for me time.  My favorite menu here is the matcha latte üíö.  Apart from the matcha latte, the drinks here are also delicious.  The price is also standard, which is under 25,000.  Apart from selling drinks, here they also sell some delicious food, moreover, the donuts are really delicious and cheap üòÉ.  For those of you who like to do assignments alone, you can really try this Nakoa cafe.

The place so comfy for works both indoor and outdoor, the coffee is great too. WiFi so fast, the staff so friendly, i have a good experience at Nakoa Cafe, just need some improvement to make the toilet clean. Overall is good, i'll come again to Nakoa Cafe. Waiting for the new menu for filling my tummy.

This is a special place for co-working which makes it also a great coffee shop. Italian espresso machine Simonelli makes nice coffees and you feel like being in a sort of modern museum. Really outstanding design....well done!

I think the doughnut is a normal doughnut. It has no speciality, except the price, 9k ü§≠
The coffe was also tasty as normal coffe.
We can freely take a mineral water.

I ordered: matcha & strawberry cheesecake

I came here today and ordered triple flavour gelato, i pick strawberry cheesecake, snickers and strawberry flavour, the gelato was smooth, sweet and i think it's worth the price

Bliputhu claimed its own gelato as fresh, no preservative, no food coloring and low fat. And it is. Imho, this is the best gelato I've tried in Malang. Wish they have more flavors and some pancake/waffle. Besides, you can order local menus from Dapur Guntur. From Bakmi Jawa to Nasi Campur

The taste of the coffee is like warkop warkop in Makassar city, the internet connection is quite fast, suitable for work and hanging out as well as nobar, just a suggestion for the owner, for nobar it's good to provide a big screen like using a projector, so that Nobar is better, success is always for the coffee shop...

The price of coffee is cheap, the snacks are also cheap, the Wi-Fi is fast. Because of that this place is favored by many school children. Especially those who like to play mobile games. Not the right place if you are a person who prioritizes coffee taste. Coffee is perfunctory, but still very suitable for an affordable price. Suitable if you want to take a short break away from the rain. Open until midnight. Crowded on weekends. You can bring snacks from outside, because here the snack stock is often empty"

Not spacious at all, can't imagine what it feels like when it's full.
It's hot, at night and the ac are not on, cant even open the windows.

A good place to eat with your family and friends, they have a lot of seats, the price is cheap for each meatball, and they have some set menu so the total price will be cheaper

The place is small but comfortable especially for waiting in line, or flash bites between patient shifts.

The decoration of the room is cool, utilizing the corner space on the 2nd floor. The furniture is also a combination of classic and modern which really blends together.

But what's a bit annoying is actually the barista might be even cooler if you use a barista apron with the cafe branding. Because several times the barista came here wearing the UMM Hospital employee uniform batik. So it kind of loses the feel of the cafe a bit üòÖ

For the menu, I like caramel macchiato the most. The sweetness is just right, a little sweet, but still safe, not as sweet as in cafes in general.

Overall recommended for hospital visitors or patient caretakers

I said quite unique, why unique?
This cafe is located on the second floor of the Malang Muhammadiyah university general hospital, a quite comfortable cafe..

Love the atmosphere and the food.
It is worth the price. And it is quite cheap compare to other cafes in Malang.

However, it took soooo much time for the food to be ready. Maybe because it's always crowded with people.
Also, they played the music so loud. So you might reconsider to visit this place if you like a quiet place. But they also provide a special room for study or work, so you might use that.

Don't ride a car to visit this place, it's hard to find the parking lot.

Semusim Cafe is on St. MT. Haryono Malang, exactly across from Brawijaya University. This cafe has two floors which are always busy every day with visitors who are mostly students. This cafe sells cheap food and drinks so it is suitable for student pockets, prices start from 7,000 to 20,000. This cafe is open every day, open from 10.00 to 00.00. This cafe has a Scandinavian decoration concept so it is very interesting to visit. and apart from that this cafe also has air-conditioned first floor facilities, there are sockets on each table without worrying about running out of battery, as well as a prayer room for Muslim visitors. Meanwhile, the second floor is a smoking zone as well as a place to carry out tasks. This floor cafe is non-AC, it won't feel hot because of the lots of ventilation and the use of fans to provide extra comfort to visitors.

Price is so affordable. Taste is okay not so extraordinary, only got the problem with too much sweetness for the drink. Place is well and nice, so comfy and having a decent interior.

Strategically located accross the uni. Very affordable price, cute interior, nice ambience (although mostly very crowded), food taste exceeds my expectations."

Good vibes n taste, next to UB libraryüëå

The location is very strategic because it is in front of the library of Universitas Brawijaya, the menu varies, prices are competitive. Can be enjoyed directly on the benches in front of the library. The solution for those who are lazy to leave campus."

The staffs are friendly, some tables r equipped w/ electric socket.
The place is also clean n neat.
They provide trash bin for the customers to throw the plastic glass after drinking.
I love it that they use paper straw instead of the one made of plastic

Strategically located in the crowded places like university and schools. Great variation of sofas, chairs, and tables to choose from. Very delicious coffee.

The only drawback is the space. It's actually big enough, but all of the crowd and promotions renders this place less spacious.

One of the cozy place, its located around the corner of the mall, very visible, and yet the coffee just like a story of having companion with

Starbucks Indonesia should fire their digital marketing department or whoever is in charge of the website information. We looked up store info from Indonesia Starbucks website to get the address of this Starbucks. We took a taxi and travelled 30 minutes in traffic to arrive at......this?! Wouldn‚Äôt Starbucks Indonesia know this location is going through renovation and received the tenant notification months ago? (I don‚Äôt think the landlord would just demolish the Starbucks shop overnight). From the look of it, the renovation has been going on for at least several weeks. Why wouldn‚Äôt Starbucks Indonesia update the official website information? Incompetence and laziness might be the answer."

Coffee taste decent. Too bad they have a very limited options for food. But still a good option if you want to escape the city loud noise.

Lovely and quiet place. The staffs are friendly, the price is affordable. You should try their Es Rempah.

They make you feel's like home!  Quite place for escape from crowd for a moment.  They also will serve you with a nice coffee,  sweet smile and with happiness.

It's a very refreshing place. With bamboo trees at the side of this ""Tiny House"",  located at shaded place, this Coffee Shop, certainly could make you relax. Furthermore, they serve a great quality of coffee (oh, and there's chocolate too). The hospitality from the owner, too, makes this place a great place to go. Make your moments in here!

Their single origin were aces, limited choices for latte however, incredible service and hospitality in their own way, place is pretty hard to find on maps but you can just chat the owner and he will guide you through, open 10 am till 10 pm.

that's it. goodluck!!!

was here when they just opened the store and comin back here when the store is wider with a collab to Dua Legenda. the coffee is a real mantap jaya. the cashier is so polite and helpful. a great experience. will come back for sure.

The coffee shop decoration is like in the 40's but yeah nothings really cool, in the other hand the coffee is quite good

Overall imo, coffees are quite good with affordable price for such experience and histories. Nachos were very good too, but the combination with coffee were not working well. Ambience is good too for hangout or work. Worth to try and will come back again.

This place is great for you who wanna spend some quality time with friends while enjoying good costly dishes and drinks. They serve selections of signature coffee. I tried their Vegan Fuel something, consisting of soy milk, espresso and sugar. I actually loved it. For the food, I ordered their beef blackpepper rice. To me, it's just fine.
Unfortunately, since there was no indoor seating available, we had to pick outdoor tribune to enjoy our orders and it wasn't a nice experience. The weather was windy and a bit chilly, so you can imagine how uncomfortable it is. Plus, the tribune is not suitable for eating something served on a plate.

Went here for brunch and it was very perfect, the place was great, every single spot is absolutely instagram worthy.

Various menu from snacks, desserts and drinks and they're all so pretty and yummy. the cafe owner is very friendly to his customer.

The parking area is so wide. Once I enter the coffee shop, the waitress offered me to sit in the indoor area with sofa because she saw me with a baby. It has online order system with e-payment, but don't worry we can still pay with cash.
It's so comfortable because it also has praying room which is so clean.

Complete package. Nice place just to hang or dine in. Good food, awesome coffee.
The basic ice americano with fruity beans, not my personal preference but still, great!
The white butter rum by far is favorite. Price is reasonable too.

minimalistic place,
Suitable for assignments or work and gathering together
The menu is also varied.
Prices start from 20 thousand ++

The first time to Kopi Titik Koma in Tidar. The atmosphere is really good for coffee or working alone and makes you feel at home. Moreover, the staff is also friendly and super help full.

There is a prayer room and the toilets are also clean, so for those who want WFC here it's really good. It's a shame that the toilet is a bit problematic because the spray section for wiping water only comes out a little. Hopefully it can be fixed asap.

Cozy enough for wfc alone or with friends. Each table does have a plug but only 1, so if you want to use it for a crowd you have to bring your own coiled cable. Wifi is quite smooth. Semicolon standard coffee menu and prices. Worth it for occasional try"

The location is quite strategic, which is near the back gate of the UIN Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang campus, and next to the babershop. At Mletik Coffee, the menu choices of coffee and non-coffee drinks and food are very diverse, the taste is good with prices that are classified as standard and cheap. The place is spacious with lots of benches and sockets that make beta to linger there. The wifi network is very smooth, the service there is also very friendly, the place is always clean and tidy, and the atmosphere cannot be used to make Mletik coffee an option to enjoy coffee while working or just chatting casually.
""Very recommended at a very friendly priceü§©ü§©ü§©""

meletik cafe is my favorite place in Malang, usually I go after sunset around six o'clock, I go with friends to do assignments there, usually I order noodles and drink milktea there are also lots of snacks and coffee either hot or cold, I like it the cafe is because the place is close to the boarding house and is also strategic but I don't like it because the cafe is mostly guys who hang out than girls

Have a nice and comfortable place to meet and interact with friends. The menu prices are cheap and the service is friendly, the opening hours are also until the early hours. Suitable for a cool hangout.

#Up date price list for STMJ Jagalan 21 Nov 2019#

This includes the Legendary STMJ in Malang, the first time I came here was in 2011. In terms of location, there really hasn't been any change, it's still the same as before, the place is small, but the visitors are never empty.
One thing that is also a point, free parking in front of the shop is a bit on the side of the road.
The atmosphere is far from Cozy, like roadside stalls, but visitors feel at home for a long time while enjoying their drinks!üòÅüòÑ

STMJ is delicious
There are STMJ ingredients
There are fried
You can borrow a carpet on the floor
Don't forget to return

The place is so comfy, especially for doing some work or task with your laptop (WiFi is available here).

I ordered ice milk coffee called Pasti Kopi Susu and it turned out good.

Surprisingly at this nylempit place you can find  a cozy place to hang with your friends or just doing your stuff on laptop.

The coffee they serve is quite interesting. You can find es kopi susu with brown sugar here. Si refreshing!

Their accident coffee (maksudnya kopi tubruk) is quite strong. Its aroma is very good.

Lots of interesting drinks. Coffee, tea, or.. me? üòúüòú

But the camilans they serve is rather limited. Their cinnamon roll bun is quite nice. You can cokot it than use fork or spoon.

I like their interior design. Especially at evening. You can get beautiful selfie-selfie here.

Nice place.

And very helpful and friendly owner.

Well I think this place is pretty much great except for the fact that the air conditioner is not working. It was a rainy afternoon, I needed place for my homework and I remembered my friend told me about this place a long time ago. They have small room and limited table which is fine to me, but with limited air circulation I am getting sweaty and sweaty then I decided to leave. Fix the air conditioner and perhaps I‚Äôll go there again someday.

Even though its location takes more effort to reach from the main street, you'll be glad to discover some of their finest beverages... especially coffee. I personally choose their ""Pasti Kopi Susu"" as it suits my taste so well, it has a gentle flavor which is hard to describe here, so just find out yourself. The atmosphere of this place is great, many good spot to take beauty shot or a perfect selfie for your social media needs. I love their fast wifi connection and calm indie music playing in the background. Both barista are also cheerful and definitely the person you'll be willing to tell your story with.

Good place for work on your laptop, the room is small, their coffee tasted good"

this time I will tell you about my experience and what I feel after visiting this cafe. The first time I visited this cafe with my junior high school friend in Malang, he to be the one who told me about this place. okay, at that time we visited this place at 10 pm, this place is still crowded, it just so happens that this cafe has 3 floors, the first floor is the cashier and also a few tables for visitors, then on the 2nd floor is an indoor room where this room is covered with glass, lots of tables and mostly used by students who want to do assignments. because on the 2nd floor there is no smoking allowed. so it is very comfortable to work in focus. on the 2nd floor there is also a toilet whose design is very futuristic and of course interesting. okay, because at that time I sat on the 3rd floor there was a lively atmosphere, lots of people hanging out with their friends because the rooftop on this floor allowed smoking, there is also a bar here and there are lots of tables on the 3rd floor, we can also see the city lights. and the service at this cafe is quite good, the employees are friendly, but because the place is very busy it makes them a bit of a hassle.

I just passed through Malang and so happen got tired and get some rest here. The cappucino was meh, it taste like instant coffee. The ice cream was nice, I buy kopyor ice cream and it's decent for 15RB price. Not so sweet just as I like it. The place was spacious. Lot's of collage students there getting some work done. Pretty cheap and cozy fast internet and clean. I went to 3rd floor and since Malang is kinda cold that day it's really nice. Overall 7/10. Maybe after taste some dishes I could increase it. Maybe next time

Cheap food and coffee, wide and comfy, dont use 3rd floor if it sunny.. too hot. Okay when at night

WOW is one of the cafes located in Malng City. With a very aesthetic location and suitable for doing tasks because of its convenient and cool location.
There is also live music so we don't get bored to hang out there. However , the prices there do not match student friendly , students and even boarding children like me with drinks priced above 20,000 Because I think it's expensive.
However, the menu is not boring. The special menu at WARUNK WOW KWB is Rice Bowl, Indomie, Roti Bakar (Rotkar), Coffee which is famous as a cheap menu with priced under 20.000 . But with a modern and luxurious presentation."

Foods and beverages generally taste decent, not bad, but not at the high end of the chart too, for example the donuts we ordered when we visited the place, were too chewy, but overall nothing‚Äôs to be complained for, especially they comes with fair prices.

Place is excellent, both the interior and the exterior, the rooftop might be the best. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Quite recommended, best visit the place at night.

The place is in the center of city, I recommend you to go there in the night because you can see the light along the kayutangan road. The food is tasty and the service is very good. You should try the rooftop floor.

Really nice place and affordable food!! I‚Äôve been here a view times and i always had a decent time. The place is also very instagramable, it had a really nice design. 10/10 recommended‚ú®

Great & comfy place, for romantic dinner or hangin out with your pals. The vallet parking service is not quite friendly though, shows how differently they treat the high class cars and standard class cars. Pls improve your service equality and quality. Overall food was grear, drinks were ok, and the desserts were yummy.

Unfortunately I had the bad experience with the meal here.
I was here for late lunch and the weather was amazing, I decided to dine in upstairs with air breeze in Malang.
I've ordered Dahayu Tea and the taste was refreshing, its taste sour and sweet smell, just like berries does.

Hospitality was amazing. I enjoyed the quick order proses with the staff and I did not mind to go downstaird to pick up my order and went back again upstairs.

But the meal, I was so sad I had to feel disappointed with this food, the asparagus chicken.
Chicken was served in a hotplate and I hardly wait to try with sauce.

Chicken was hot.
But the sauce was cold as fff, same with the mini croquet and veggies.

I do not know what was going on that day, but all part of meals should served hot. But not for the sauce, even when I mixed the cold sauce and hot chicken, its meal temperature lowering to room tempie.

Not good.
I really not planning to coming back here."

Better take outdoor seating if it wasn't raining and you don't mind seat at smoking area. Coffee's okay, reasonable prices. Don't even think to visit on weekend, unless you only need take-away.

The ambience is not really great for work or study because it's pretty crowded but if you go here only for hanging out, it's quiet good. 7/10 for the americano. 7/10 for the sweet karaage. The place will crowded quickly as soon as it opened. Better reserved a table first before come here

+ Love the color palette of this cafe
+ The bar is so cute
+ Love the Wastafel area
+ Indoor and outdoor
+ Cute concept
- Limited parking lot
- Their food is not quite tasty
- Some furniture finishing is ugly

I came here when this coffe shop just open about a week, so during my visit this cafe always busy. I like their concept about recycling old house into new cafe, without break down the house.
Love their outdoor ceiling, because they use clear ceiling.

A coffee shop that has a unique concept in Malang is different from other coffee shops. It gets an 8/10 for ambiance because it's cute and unique. There are also quite a lot of seats provided, but the place is not too wide for a coffee shop because it is located in a residential area. It looks like this coffee shop is only suitable for chatting with friends and not for doing assignments because the place is quite noisy and crowded, so it's not comfortable if you need a place that's not noisy. For food and drink, I give a rating of 9/10 because it is delicious and unique, and the price is cheap. Various kinds of drinks and food are provided here. From snacks to heavy meals, and in my opinion, all the menus don't fail because they match their appearance with what is on the menu. Service 8.5/10 due to self-service drinks and food delivered by the waitress. Besides that, for those of you who like to take pictures here, a photobox is provided. for which, of course a separate fee is charged.

Other than that, there's nothing too special. I got myself a Hazelnut, and i like it.

the place is comfortable for chatting and looking for a new atmosphere. especially because it is located next to the train tracks. not suitable for those of you who want to do something with a laptop because there are no electrical plugs.

I like the view. Kopi Baja Hitam is my best view. LOL üòÇ

but seriously, when I first saw this place, I really love it ü§©There's so many cafes by the train tracks in Malang, but I think Kopi Baja Hitam's ambience suits my taste. To be honest, the design and the layout is like millenial cafes in general with nature concept. But... if you are sunset-catcher person or street view lovers, you'll love this. This cafe is semi-outdoor and there's a rooftop! You can watch the birds, the streets, and the most exciting thing is you can watch the passing train! This cafe will be my go-to when I feel stress and overwhelm, the ambience can calm my mind.
I also love the food, the price is reasonable but yummy! I like the potato wedges, so cooked and crunchy. The lychee tea is also fresh, not-too sweet, and not artificial.

Price: 5/5
Ambience: 5/5
Food: 5/5 (Potato wedges: Rp12.000,00)
Drinks: 5/5 (Ice lychee tea: Rp12.000, Hot red velvet: Rp12.000)

the place are very nice, quite cozy (if you guys can stand the trains) but the serving almost 45mins, apparently for the way they responded when i asked about my order, they forgot about it, and the waiter didn't say a word or apologise, the iced coffee taste like water and didn't have the consistentcy to be called a ""coffee"".

just a normal coffee shop with train view"

this place is perfect for solo experience. located beside a main road, you could have your coffee and snack while seeing vehicles passing by. price is totally affordable and they make their drinks wholeheartedly. thai tea is good. matcha even better.

My first time going to coffee shop in Malang, end up wanting to always be back. Its ambiance is cozy and artsy. The prices are reasonable with good quality foods and drinks (around Rp8,500 until Rp25,000-all menus except for pizza is Rp38,000). The portion of some foods can be shared.
Black tea is recommended to be ordered! Moreover for a person who can't drink coffee, like me.
The coffee shop provides a mini prayer room, or you can find masjid near it, and its located at MAN 2 Malang (it takes about 2-3 minutes by walking). Other facilities are available there, such as toilets which need to be kept clean, wifi, books, electrical socket and parking lot.

The staffs are good and helpful, the toilet is clean, and the prayer‚Äôs room is neat and clean (it provides a very fragrant prayer‚Äôs mat and prayer‚Äôs set).

My favorite beverage from this cafe is Milkshake. I didn't find a matcha milkshake for this cafe. When I was a college student, this cafe was always crowded but cozy and quiet.

I recommended Work From Cafe in this place. This cafe must maintain the furniture and interior, but for the taste always be lovely, for waitpersons must smile and be friendly to the customer. BTW, this cafe must pay attention to the plating.

Nice and cozy place and they have smoking (outdoor) and non-smoking (indoor) areas separated. Free Wi-fi and power outlets are available. I think the number of the tables is a little bit small, not surprising because the place is not big. Nevertheless, with the right and nice interiors and light, it feels spacious enough. They apply the new normal protocol so we found that some tables are not in used. I think the chair could be imrpoved, though. I certainly like it if it more comfortable, especially if I want to do my work in the place.
We tried the apple pie, which is part of the pastries displayed at the front counter. It was scrumptious, with the perfect crispy, flaky dough and the right sweetness and sourness of the apple filling. The caesar salad comes as a combination of lettuces, generous amount of grilled chicken, and a slice of garlic bread but with different dressing than the usual yellow caesar dressing I used to know. It uses some kind of mayonnaise combined with certain herbs and spices I think? Kinda tasted the parsley in the dressing somehow. It tasted nice and fresh.
The salted spicy tofu is good, although I prefer mine to be a little bit more salty. It comes with a separate sauce made of sweet soy sauce and chili flakes. The vegetables cream soup tasted good but the texture is somehow quite thick, reminds me of a very thick porridge instead of soup. They're certainly generous with the amount of the vegetables, however.
The chocolate+milk is quite nice, while the iced lemon tea is proved to be a hit for me (definitely want to order it again!). We're lucky enough to get a free ice cream waffle with minimum 100K rupiahs purchase (choose between chocolate, strawberry, or banana one). The strawberry waffle comes with strawberry ice cream, strawberry slices, strawberry jam, and whipped cream that I found very rare used in the waffle sold here in the city. The offer will last until the end of August, by the way.

This place is cozy and classy. You can see yellowish color across the room, so it makes you hungry as soon as you enter the room and almost don't wanna leave it :)) but, if you want to sit comfortably, you may come at afternoon or evening here since this place is too crowded at night. Don't worry about the food and beverages quality, 5 stars are for all menu. Standing applause!

The pecel stall is very clean. The seller's mother is friendly. The pecel portion is just right, the taste is delicious. There are also other additional side dishes. It's right in front of the gas station.

This place sells pecel in the morning and STMJ in the evening. STMJ or a mixed drink of MILK, EGG, HONEY and GINGER is priced at a low price of only 12,000 Rupiah. Besides STMJ there is also a toast menu. It's a perfect match. Drink STMJ and Toast at night. For those of you who like half-cooked free-range chicken eggs, you can also order at this place. The location is also easy to find because it is on the side of the main road and is included in an area that is often passed by

The taste of ordinary pecel is delicious, there are a variety of side dishes and drinks. The food is fresh, the vegetables are fresh, the food looks clean and attractive. The price is affordable. I eat pecel with a side dish of skewered meat, the meat is delicious, I think the pecel is a little less salty, or maybe it's typical for pecel to be served like that.

It's really worth it bro. Pecel is close to UB. The taste is good although not the most delicious. With a price of 10k and quite filling. Very suitable for backpackers who are more economical spending. Oh yes, additional side dishes are also available at various prices but still cheap. The thick omelet is only 2k. The location is opposite the gas station near the intersection."

But not with their interior design, so similar with Starbucks. Let's say it's a local Starbucks. It feels like they don't have their own characteristics. Still better for me, since they have excellent staff and their coffee is superb!

After exploring many coffee shops, I found one coffee shop which I think is really worth it for students like us to visit üòÄ.  Nakoa cafe Bondowoso is one of my favorite hangout cafes, it seems I have visited this cafe countless times.  The reason why Nakoa is my favorite cafe is that most of the people who come here are students doing their assignments, so it makes the atmosphere of the cafe calm and not chaotic.  The people at Nakoa also don't care about visitors, so I think Nakoa is really good for me time.  My favorite menu here is the matcha latte üíö.  Apart from the matcha latte, the drinks here are also delicious.  The price is also standard, which is under 25,000.  Apart from selling drinks, here they also sell some delicious food, moreover, the donuts are really delicious and cheap üòÉ.  For those of you who like to do assignments alone, you can really try this Nakoa cafe.

The place so comfy for works both indoor and outdoor, the coffee is great too. WiFi so fast, the staff so friendly, i have a good experience at Nakoa Cafe, just need some improvement to make the toilet clean. Overall is good, i'll come again to Nakoa Cafe. Waiting for the new menu for filling my tummy.

This is a special place for co-working which makes it also a great coffee shop. Italian espresso machine Simonelli makes nice coffees and you feel like being in a sort of modern museum. Really outstanding design....well done!

I think the doughnut is a normal doughnut. It has no speciality, except the price, 9k ü§≠
The coffe was also tasty as normal coffe.
We can freely take a mineral water.

The place is quite large and cozy for having chit chat"

Nice ambience. Good food & coffee. Fair price

3 stars is too low but for 5 stars...Bhava definitely needs to work a lot more.

Having passed this place several times, I finally stepped in it last night.

Being seen from the road, Bhava seems cramped. In fact, it is a roomy corridor with warm lighting and nice match of colors. An array of 12 semi-industrial style table sets are neatly placed to accommodate couples or families indoor as well as 3 set for those who love it outdoor.

Having not so many items in the menu represents Bhava's dedication to the food taste and quality for customers' satisfaction.
Their food, indeed, indulge our tastebud surprisingly.

Yet, I have to be honest; serving speed is Bhava's weak point. While only one other table occupied by customers, a 30-minute wait for one of 4 meals in the order to appear is never good enough. If 4 of the tables are occupied by families simultaneously, the last to submit order may have to watch an empty table for 2 hours with growling tummy.
I believe this place can come up with better work rythm to compose more melodic eating experience.

Nice place to hang out with friends and families. Good coffee, good food.

great coffee, they have in-house roastery, and you could buy roasted coffee beans there, and ask them to grind it if you didn't have grinder at home. the only minus for me, is the mushola looks so dirty, and hidden in the 2nd floor, and didn't really well kept & clean

but I do highly recommend the smoking / non-smoking room, for a casual or business meeting. I usually visit Labore after 19.00, their night vibe is also lovely.

Great place to hang out. All menus that we tried was delicious. Not much space in the non-smoking area.

Very comfortable cafe that serves good quality of tea, coffee, snacks and main courses. Indoor and outdoor seatings are available. Smoking and non-smoking seats are for your choices.

Dizzy Coffee.. French Fries IDR 10,000 But PORTIONS ARE MALANG RAYA CHAMPIONS

Wow, I never thought that in the Ciliwung area, Malang, there is really good coffee..

Product: I ordered Es Coffee Coconut, it tasted really good... my friend, who doesn't like coffee that much, took a sip and immediately said ""mmmm yummmm"". That means it's really good because my friend is the most fussy about food and drink.

Price: the price is standard but in accordance with the taste. The price for Ice Coffee Coconut is only IDR 18,000, guys.. French fries are only IDR 10,000 but the portion, Masha Allah, is a lot, guys, and the taste is really good too...

Place: even though I ordered take away but at first glance I saw that the place was quite comfortable for hanging out... and the location is on the side of the road so it's really easy to find.

Service: friendly service, even though I came with flip flops and all black clothes..

Please, those who miss good coffee can immediately attack the place....

The drinks are great

The place is difficult to find a car park. Very roadside location.

For the price, it's still above the lower limit for cafe prices in Malang, yes, but it's worth it because the place is good, bro, the coffee is also good. Price range if I'm not mistaken 15k-30s

The atmosphere is calm even though the roadside is a bit congested and almost always crowded, especially near gacoan, you know how to do gacoan for yourself

The only minus is the space, which is not too big and not too small, while the plus is that there is an individual seat facing the wall. The seats are actually proportional to the overall space, but I personally think it's a bit too small.

The majority of seats are outdoor, indoor non smoking only 1 seat set, I guess.

The service is a little above standard which is good because the standard is actually already good. If you pay using QRIS (QR Code), the qr code is printed specifically for customer transactions, so you don't need to enter a nominal again like in most cafes today.

Thanks for the experience

So-so.. small place, less parking, really standard coffee.. The image of the Capucinno lgs disappears before you drink it and it's not hot at all"

I ordered mie goreng and tea., the tea taste really good. Mie goreng was abit salty., next time should try the coffee. I went there before christmas, they put nice christmas ornaments

The atmosphere there is good.
But the food there is not really satisfying. Honey chicken was either over-fried or fried again and the taste is very ordinary. Not going to pay a cafe price for that kind of food quality.
There heritage noodles also taste just like mie goreng from any other street food stores. Sorry to say, taste and potion are better in those food stores.
So, not very recommend to eat there.
However, the coffee is ok.

If you're a morning person, this place may suit your appetite looking for new ideas. It has an Instagrammable view at every corner. There are variety of coffee and food menu when you're looking forward of a big breakfast. The price is in middle range. It's not too expensive nor too cheap as well. But, the taste of the food is so so for me. The service is okay despite I've had uncomfortable event when the waiter was reluctantly serving us breakfast. Maybe I should come another day to

Beli menu kopi di pagi hari free donat. Must try sarsaparila, caramel machiato, enoki crispy.

Honestly their interior is a bit off. Their menus are okay but please, if you're in a small indoor place don't put your music volume too loud! Your customers will not get comfy and ended up not buying more of your menus!

the place is comfy. a good place for u, instagram-slave haha. pricey, at least for me. love the toilet. clean. the 2nd floor is to die for. they provide tables with sofas and live music on the 2nd floor. u can also see the night street through the balcony. the food is good. definitely a place for u to hang out

My personal favorite coffee shop in Malang.
The food and drinks I‚Äôve ordered always taste right on my buds.

I fell in love with the place thanks to the sofas area on the 2nd floor. They look a lot like a family restaurant in the west lol! It‚Äôs cute and private. The WiFi is fast and consistent, so you definitely can study, work, or just enjoy your netflix comfortably. I always visited the place in the morning till afternoon so far, and it‚Äôs never been too crowded. Perhaps because I haven‚Äôt stop by at its peak hour.

They accept ovo as well which is good.

It's a two-story cafe so the place is quite spacious. The theme for the 1st and 2nd floor is different, the 1st floor interior looks like a common yet comfy interior you'd find in any typical cafe. The 2nd floor looks like a family dinner place, the other section looks like casual-colorful themed, the terrace is woody-themed [?]

Their drink tastes alright and the pricing is no different than other caf√©s (around IDR 20K and up). We bought a toast and mozzarella stick, hmm... the taste and presentation can be improved.

There's a lot of seating arranged for small to large group. We went there around 8 PM and sat on the 2nd floor terrace. I tell you it's not the best place to enjoy the night. Although the cafe itself located in a strategic place with good parking space, the road is way too busy and noisy for you to hold a proper conversation without raising your voice. Even though the 1st floor music sounds a bit louder, I suppose it's better that way because you'd hear less noise from the busy road."

Oh yeah, there's a lot on the menu here! what I'm trying this time is;

1. Milk base charcoal
2. Sweet mango yakult
3. Spicy Tofu
4. Chicken ori barbeque sauce with mayo

When I tried the chicken ori barbeque, it tasted really good! the chicken meat is abundant & not much skin is rich in other places! Barbeque sauce & mayonnaise here are not stingy either. You can get one special portion of this for only 14K!

The place is hidden in a small road and unexpected üòä I found it by chance but it was actually a nice surprise. I like the setting especially the veranda outside. A free setting makes the place look bigger and relaxing atmosphere is obvious here.
The drinks are good and the sushi is ok.
Lots of parking place for motorcycles but the cars have  to park on the side road next to it. Worth a try üòäüòä

Affordable good food with big portions, better sit outside under the shade because the indoor building is too hot even if all aircons were turned on. The service from the waiter/waitress was good, but not for the cashier. The cashier lady was unfriendly and not very welcoming towards me & my friends, she handled our order lazily like she didn't want to be there.

Love the ambiance. It's located in a quiet neighbourhood. Vast parking area. Very bright, the place will put you in a good mood once your glance at it. Really love the outdoor area. Best time to come here I think is around 3-5p.m. Coupled with Malang fresh air. Definitely a place for a fun gathering with friends. Food was alright. We ordered School Dosirak and Jjajangmyeon, with Itaewon (ReVe drink) and Hongdae (milk w/ salted caramel). Itaewon drink could be better. Hongdae was tasty. The staffs were very friendly and helpful.

Love the atmosphere here. For those who want to feel the Korean vibe and who like K-Pop, it's really suitable here. The parking lot is quite wide and next to Sejenak Coffee.
The interior design looks simple from the outside, as soon as you enter, you immediately feel the Korean vibes because of the Korean decorations and music being played. Aesthetic in every corner.
There are quite a lot of indoor and outdoor places. In the indoor area, there is a really good photobox. In the outdoor area there is a pojangmacha selling street food.
The menu options vary, from snacks to heavy meals. There is a grill package menu, ramyeon and other menus such as mandu, kimbab and many more. For drinks, there are quite a few choices. There is also a showcase filled with bottled and canned drinks. Prices range is 23 thousand - 55 thousand rupiahs. Suitable for lunch or dinner. Or hanging out, snacking, and enjoying the vibes is also okay. If you're expecting food in k-drama, you'll find it here.

Just put an event to create a crowd

Yuhuuu buy 1 get 1 free..!

It's still in the Kayutangan Heritage section, although it's a bit out of the way. But it's better here, the ambiance is nice and not too crowded. In the center of Kayutangan Heritage, you can't expect it because it's crowded with people, I can't enjoy it if I am (the part of the street with lots of lights)

The place is spacious and clean, food and drinks are affordable too. Prices listed include tax. Friendly and prompt service. Try the Teh Tarik, it's really fresh and not too sweet. The toast is small in portion but delicious too. Top really. There are selling heavy food, Nasi Jeruk but I didn't try it.

Hopefully it can be crowded as well as other cafes in the center of Kayutangan Heritage.

Kopte merupakan cafe baru yg terletak di sepanjang Kayutangan Heritage. Letaknya yg strategis mnjadi kelebihan cafe ini. Tempat parkir cukup luas soalnya sudah ada tukang parkir nya. Suasana cukup nyaman meskipun agak panas karena tidak ada AC. Pelayanannya ramah dan cepat. Harga tergolong murah karena berkisar antara 13k keatas. Menu andalan tentu saja kopi tarik dan teh tarik yang rasanya khas karena dibuat langsung fresh. Juga bisa lihat proses pembuatannya secara langsung. Overall recomended buat yg mau ngopi murah di sekitar Kayutangan.

‚Ä¢ Sorry I didn't take a photo of the drink, because it's really basic, really plain glasses don't have letterhead like the one on the branding
‚Ä¢ As for the taste, it's really delicious, a type of tea that's bitter and not too sweet, the process of making it is really pulled between one cup and another
‚Ä¢ the cup size is also regular, so for those who like to be thirsty or usually with large portions, it's not recommended, there's no large size
‚Ä¢ I suggest that please give the characteristics of screen printing on the plastic cup, because if it's plain, it doesn't make any difference from tea, it's 5,000 on the side of the road, especially at a price of 15,000 and above"

The taste of the drink is delicious, there are various flavors and toppings.. For the flavor variants, they also follow the trend, the new one is Dalgona Coffee. With a relatively cheap price, especially for the size to buy at the Tea Break mall, it's really cheap. Usually the queue is quite long.. The portion is also medium, not too small/too big; just right.. My favorites are Choco milk and Brown sugar milk. Recommended.

TEA BREAK really deserves 5 stars from me! the place is really big and in my opinion the booth is the widest than the other drink stands. the employees are friendly. no one is jutek like that. really really fun. the cup seal is strong. I once bought a lot and until the house there is no leak at all. it still tastes good too. My favorite is the matcha milk variant! it's really good, it's cheap again. really don't disappoint. tea breaks also often hold giveaways, you know, friends. Try to follow Instagram, I'm sure there will be lots of promo announcements or Gitcuu giveaways. anyway, for all of you boba lovers, you really have to try a tea break!

There are various drinks here which I think are quite fresh at affordable prices. Starting from pure tea to milk tea, there is. Student price range. It's located on the top floor of MOG's Foodcourt. Can request less ice yeeey. The service is fast enough, so it's recommended for those who are in a hurry"". My fav menu is green tea milk tea topping grass jelly & thai milk tea. I prefer grass jelly because it's easier to chew hehe. If boba is delicious, but chewing makes it a bit sticky on my teeth. Happy holidays üôÄ

Honestly this place has a very nice building and interiors are very nice. But the service itself is not even decent. I ordered asem asem bola daging, the food looks very nice and i was really craving for this, but one thing was that i couldn‚Äôt eat spicy food for today for particular reason. When i ordered the food, ive asked the waiter TWICE wether the food was spicy or not, and the waiter has confirmed, that it‚Äôs not spicy, yes he confirmed it twice and i heard it very clearly about every single word that he said that the food ISNT SPICY, i believed it and gave it a chance. I have placed all my hopes for this food but when the food came, it came with tons of chili, it wasn‚Äôt even 5 or 10, it was more than 10. I tried to separate the chili from the soup but it didn‚Äôt do anything, this made me very dissatisfied. When the waiter had said that this asem asem wasn‚Äôt spicy AT ALL, and turns out it was very VERY spicy. The steak was also raw, and the sauce taste was normal, i wont even say its worth for my money. This restaurant is disappointing.

Love the food and interior design. Service is also good. However be prepared to spend a lot here as its very pricey."

Overall...üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç

One of my favorite place to hangout. Cafe with Scandinavian concept design. The food and coffee is good, i love their lasagna, super duper mouth watering! Big portion with affordable price. Now they also served pastry, pretzel, sourdough etc. The place is clean, nice place for work or just hangout with friends. There are outdoor and indoor area. The outdoor area is so comfy with pool and coffee table with chair, while the indoor area is bright, clean and cozy. The toilet is big and clean.

I really like this place, definitely would come back and be my choice to spend my time to leisure or working. This restaurant concept is Scandinavian themed, from the design, language, choice of food on the menu, and anything in it.

The taste of their food especially the fried rice is excellent, very tasty and lot of beef. The drink is also good. The snacks i bought, french fries, is also good on the sauce. Tha price is fair with the taste and quality. The place overall is also good and well built.

There are plenty of seat, outdoor, indoor, either on first or second floor. Lot of facility is available, toilet, musholla, valet parking for car, etc. The staff is also friendly and kind, and their service is made me satisfied. There's also live music on weekdays night if I'm not mistaken. They also sell bread here, so there's a bakery or patisserie in here.

went here for brunch and it was perfect. The place was great, every single spot is absolutely instagram worthy. Various menu from snacks, desserts and drinks and they're ALL so pretty. Most of the customers come with their friends or family. Or you can just go by yourself, doing some online task from laptop while enjoying some of their snacks

It's a little bit crowded in the weekend, but still can enjoy the good atmosphere. You can enjoy a life music here. For me, I don't really like the atmosphere if want to spend a long day :("

The coffee served at the coffee shop ""PORTAL COFFEE MALANG"" is coffee from the Malang region. There are Arabica coffees such as Arjuno, Kawi, Parangtedjo, and Selorejo Dau. Then there is Robusta coffee which is a mainstay, namely SRIDONORETNO (DAMPIT) coffee.

Previously, Portal Coffee Malang was one location with The Roots Barbershop Malang. But now the two have moved to separate locations near the old place. The most favorite here is of course the processed coffee. In the afternoon, visitors can also see the coffee roasting process for themselves. There are various types of robusta and arabica coffee beans on offer. Starting from Malang local products and several other areas. Good preparations include palm sugar milk coffee, brewed coffee, V60, afogato, and others. For those who don't like coffee, there are choices of traditional drinks such as wedang uwuh, nasi kencur and turmeric tamarind. Quality and taste to be reckoned with."

The place: spacious, but need more working table and eliminate those cafe-esque table (not sure about the second floor tho)
The food: the beef ricebowl is nice, the drink is okay

Very good service. The place is wide, not crowded. There are plugs on the side tables. The design and layout of the place is quite unique (with a car/automotive theme). The price, as I recall, starts from 5 thousand (hot tea) to 25 thousand. There are light and heavy meals as well. Free parking space.

a coffee shop that is really a must to visit, the place is comfortable, instagramable too of course, the shop has an automotive nuance that is really cool.

and don't forget that the coffee is really good, you know, there are lots of menus to choose from, of course it's delicious and cheap on the pocket

The kombucha is on point! the chicken is good but the sauce is just average.

its my first time came here. I came here with friends and order a drink and the same food for each of us.. They have a very slow service, our drink was served after 30ish minutes and the food were arrive after one (1) hour. We already go back and forth asking them and they always say that its because the rice is not ready. and we are not the only table waiting in such a loooong time like that.

It is very sad tho, they could learn something about supply chain management and communication between team to prevent this kind of issue.

The service is good, the cashier and one of the waiters are friendly and answer all our questions despite the crankyness we had (hungry due to waiting for an hour).

I like the chicken & kombuca here!

A small local restaurant/cafe with great service, food, drink and overall experience! They have a rooftop and oke bgt waktu senja2 dateng kesini!
Definitely a go-to place for cafe when you are in malang Huge portion of roasted chicken (which is tasty) & side dishes are delicious as well.

A lil bit shocked that malang has a place to drink kombucha in a market. Their kombucha is nice but i think if only they can make it more sweet. Price is not too pricey. Better come in the afternoon

The menu offered by the tavern is currently quite varied, there are ginger-based menus such as ronde and takwa, as well as angsle and several other menus. In my opinion, the price is very affordable to save your body and soul that is cold in the city wind

*at first glance, the shop is sometimes not visible because the place where the shop rises up and is covered by a tree in front of the house

Nice place.

The solution for relaxing coffee, doing assignments, and working in a very different atmosphere from the others! everything is semi outdoor with a nice breeze. the furniture uses used goods like the name of the shop, Lowak. of course still very comfortable.
the location is in the Joyosari area, for girls you know the Prabujaya clothing store, right in front of it. for guys, you know MakPar, it's close to MakPar.

uh for the price? Don't worry, it's guaranteed to be really affordable, starting at 6,000-14,000 (hopefully my memory isn't wrong). for sure it won't drain the bag even if you order it repeatedly hehe.

flavor? even though the place seems very simple, it feels like it can really compete. lots of unique ones like Lowak Ice, I think it's because everyone will have a different review hehe.

capacity? wuuu spacious place, often also for events. can accommodate up to 60 people.

Karena hari pertama, tempatnya rame bangetttt dan camilannya masih sedikit juga. I would recommend this place to you!‚ú®

Nice industrial vibes and nice grounded coffee blend

One of the cafes in Suhat is located next to the Sahid Montana hotel.  This cafe is not too wide but very homey.  The table provided is enough for groups and alone.  The menu offered is interesting, tastes good and has many choices.  Chocolate and coffee based drinks are highly recommended.  For snacks I recommend churros and fries.  One thing that is a little annoying for me personally, sometimes too many people smoke, so the smoke gathers until the table and my clothes smell of cigarette smoke, for passive smokers like me, it's quite disturbing.  Maybe there needs to be another way and regulation to handle my complaint.  thanks.

First of all, nice interior concept, just like an old gold mining site. I drank their coldbrew and it tastes great, mild and fruity. Next time I'll go there, I'd love to enjoy my coldbrew without an ice cube, it might taste a lot better. Overall, as a newcomers, they offer a great Australian culture coffeeshop. You should go there.

Have been trying their several different menus and here's my top three so far:
1. Iced hojicha; it's creamy and thick, the flavour is quite deep, not overly sweetÔºçjust a perfect bittersweet combination
2. French fries with this yellow sauce and mozzarella (I forgot the actual name in the menu üòÇ); because cheese will never be wrong!
3. Beef kebab; the sauce is exceptional!

Unfortunately, I can't give any review about their coffee because tbh my body cannot 'cooperate' at all with any coffee intake, but I can still say this is a nice place to spend the time. The place is not really wide but it's super cozy and calming„Éºsuch a perfect workspace. Not too crowded but it's not empty either. Staffs and owner are very humble and friendly, and they will explain anything if you ask them about the menu. I had a really good time here, and I won't be hesitating to visit this place again and try their other menus!"

Nice ambience. Good food & coffee. Fair price

3 stars is too low but for 5 stars...Bhava definitely needs to work a lot more.

Having passed this place several times, I finally stepped in it last night.

Being seen from the road, Bhava seems cramped. In fact, it is a roomy corridor with warm lighting and nice match of colors. An array of 12 semi-industrial style table sets are neatly placed to accommodate couples or families indoor as well as 3 set for those who love it outdoor.

Having not so many items in the menu represents Bhava's dedication to the food taste and quality for customers' satisfaction.
Their food, indeed, indulge our tastebud surprisingly.

Yet, I have to be honest; serving speed is Bhava's weak point. While only one other table occupied by customers, a 30-minute wait for one of 4 meals in the order to appear is never good enough. If 4 of the tables are occupied by families simultaneously, the last to submit order may have to watch an empty table for 2 hours with growling tummy.
I believe this place can come up with better work rythm to compose more melodic eating experience.

Nice place to hang out with friends and families. Good coffee, good food.

Edit per July 3rd, 2022:
There's a new coffee drink they added called Mario's Specialty. Why the name? Go and find it out by yourself, there's a story behind it. It tastes quite easy on the tongue with all the goodness of what the coffee beans may offer plus the richness of milk and some other secret ingredients only they - Virginia and Evan, the owner - know. You can customized the level of sweetness (standard/half/quarter) to suit your own taste. Check out the last photo I added for a quick sample of the drink. My grade for this one? 9 out of 10. Love it. It is my new standard drink whenever I visit the place. You should check it out too. I'm sure you won't disappointed on this one. Happy trying and let me know your thought on it.

Small coffee shop in a neighborhood. The coffee is quite nice and the service is very good on my two visits. The price is excellent. There is only outdoor seating for about 6 people total. Staying in this neighborhood, it‚Äôs perfect to just swing by and grab a quick coffee!!!

Great place to find a flavor, coffee and japanese dishes they have. Great!

Nice coffee

Before coming here, I often ordered food and drinks from this cafe via the Gojek application. Out of curiosity about the place, I finally took the time to come to enjoy it in person. And I don't regret it!

This cafe has a relatively small place. There are two tables with several benches. So my advice, if you want to come in a group, no more than 4 people. Even though it's small, my experience here is still fun and filling!

The food and drink menu available here is quite affordable with great taste! Because I've ordered via the Gojek application, so I'm familiar with the menus. One of the recommended and favorite menus here is Butter Rice Chicken Katsu. And it's just *chef's kiss*. The portion is enough to fill a hungry student's stomach after doing the assignment.

The owner and Ocil the black and white cat who likes to stop by here are very friendly. Ocil seems too friendly, just met him and fell asleep on my lap üòÇ But that made my experience even more memorable!

For those who want to chat casually with friends while drinking fresh coffee and eating heavy or light, this place is perfect for you! I'll definitely come back here!"

You can try to relax with friends/girlfriends. But it's a shame to go there because I just don't know what the menu and the place are. But it's a pretty cool place. And for the menu, because I happened to be there after eating, I just wanted to ice it so I didn't try the coffee. The snacks are pretty good too. It may be a confused choice to have coffee and spend time around there because there are many choices. Oh yes, the minus here is that there are a lot of buskers at night, so you have to be prepared for a lot of change.

Nice. On the edge of the rice fields, unfortunately the fields are not visible because it is night. The coffee is bali and there is gayo. The price is according to the pocket, it doesn't break. Various snacks and there are noodles. Saturday night and Sunday night it's crowded.

A decent place to cob for coffee and hang out looking for ideas to build a nation.
Good luck and more and more cafes

Spacious, cozy and has outdoor seatings. But i don't really recommend the food. It tastes just meh. And the beverages need lots of improvement, for that range of price. Haven't tried the snack and not interested in trying one.

The place is decent I would say, I especially loved the interior and outdoor settings. The cafe has transformed the dutch building with blue and white stylings. Quite different what you easily see, for me the architecture stand out when I was driving my motorcycle, piqued my curiosity.
The coffee was fine, not the best. Expecting the manual V60 Japanese brew to be more delicate but it‚Äôs mainly depend on the barista to bring out the taste.

I think this is one of those cafes where you can spend time chatting with a group of friends. Well, it's great for couples too but I think the vibe is not so much suitable for that.
First time at Hindia, we ordered hazelnut latte, some kind of tea and their platter menu. Well, I can't say something special about those three menus.
But I think they need to reconsider putting away those tables placed on the outer side of the outdoor area.

It is a coffee shop and eatery as well. Coffee is basically prepared from a group of selected beans with a coffee machine; so there is nothing special. The menu is rather complete, offering main dishes and snacks. The price is affordable and the location is strategic.

Good beverages. I ordered avocado coffee and it's pretty okay-ish. The food surprisingly came out really good. We ordered kwetiau and banana fritters. The kwetiau was great, meanwhile the banana was okay. The place overall was comfortable, but the service wasn't that great.

One of my favorite place to hangout. Cafe with Scandinavian concept design. The food and coffee is good, i love their lasagna, super duper mouth watering! Big portion with affordable price.

The outdoor area is so comfy with pool and coffee table with chair, while the indoor area is bright, clean and cozy. The toilet is big and clean.

I really like this place, definitely would come back and be my choice to spend my time to leisure or working. This restaurant concept is Scandinavian themed, from the design, language, choice of food on the menu, and anything in it.

The taste of their food especially the fried rice is excellent, very tasty and lot of beef. The drink is also good. The snacks i bought, french fries, is also good on the sauce. Tha price is fair with the taste and quality. The place overall is also good and well built.

There are plenty of seat, outdoor, indoor, either on first or second floor. Lot of facility is available, toilet, musholla, valet parking for car, etc. The staff is also friendly and kind, and their service is made me satisfied. There's also live music on weekdays night if I'm not mistaken. They also sell bread here, so there's a bakery or patisserie in here.

went here for brunch and it was perfect. The place was great, every single spot is absolutely instagram worthy. Various menu from snacks, desserts and drinks and they're ALL so pretty. Most of the customers come with their friends or family. Or you can just go by yourself, doing some online task from laptop while enjoying some of their snacks

It's a little bit crowded in the weekend, but still can enjoy the good atmosphere. You can enjoy a life music here. For me, I don't really like the atmosphere if want to spend a long day :("

-Tea Bar Leaves-

Bored with hanging out at the coffee shop, so you can shift to the tea shop. The tea here is not just any tea. The taste is very unique, it is made directly so it is guaranteed to taste fresh and distinctive. You can really request if you want sweet or sour. The price is also very affordable, from 15-25 depending on the taste variant. The stock is also sometimes empty, yes, because the seller is deliberately possible so that the original taste doesn't disappear and disappoints.

For me, who is enjoying tea for the first time, it's delicious, isn't it? Friendly and polite service. Parking is good for motorbikes. There are indoor and outdoor. Very close to the highway. Comfortable seating both inside and out. Toilets are also clean. It's cool to just sit and enjoy tea alone or with friends and family.

Thirst savior drink with various variants of processed tea and fruit drinks.

In my opinion, the most recommended are Jasmine Hibiscus and their Mogu-Mogu Tea. So refreshing!

Apart from drinks, there is now a food menu and side dishes such as chicken katsu, corn dogs and home made brownies.

Often pass by but this is the first time stopping by and finally regretting why I didn't stop by yesterday

At first I feel weird about baked red beans become a dessert. But after try one with the durian montong. It's so good, I love it, I can eat it like 3 times a week üòÇ

Recomended..so far,This is the best ice that i ever taste in malang

7 june 2019
The specialty is cooked red beans and served to be cold beverages. It has various combination, such as young coconut, durians, coctail, chocolate, etc.
The taste is very good.

They have a wide range of rad beans ice, from  the original to  durian and red ice. The taste is so good. The noodles is not too shabby too."

One of my favourite coffee shop in Malang. They occupy the same building as Inspired27, use Japan style coffee shop, I suppose. Below almost every table there are small compartment use for your bags and/or jacket, most people don't realise that tho. The prices are affordable, and I love their snacks. The ambience is quiet and nice (the one in third floor). They also have other outdoor space for smoking area in the ground area near parking spot, but I prefer the non-smoking one.
Free lemon water!

Suitable for people who want to working with your laptop. Good internet, with small space indoor, so it wont be loud and crowded. At night they also provide a outdoor seat for smoking area in the parking area, pretty crowded and not suitable to open your laptop.

Good place to take a break from the daily hustle and bustle of life, and enjoy a very gentle and variety types of coffees or other snacks here, highly recommended for you to visit this place, I am sure you will love this place and it will worth your visit, the proces are also moderate not expansive‚Ä¶

There is a prayer room and the toilets are also clean, so for those who want WFC here it's really good. It's a shame that the toilet is a bit problematic because the spray section for wiping water only comes out a little. Hopefully it can be fixed asap.

Lovely and quiet place. The staffs are friendly, the price is affordable. You should try their Es Rempah.

They make you feel's like home!  Quite place for escape from crowd for a moment.  They also will serve you with a nice coffee,  sweet smile and with happiness.

It's a very refreshing place. With bamboo trees at the side of this ""Tiny House"",  located at shaded place, this Coffee Shop, certainly could make you relax. Furthermore, they serve a great quality of coffee (oh, and there's chocolate too). The hospitality from the owner, too, makes this place a great place to go. Make your moments in here!

Price is very affordable, and their matcha tastes quite good.

However, the food menu is limited and most of them are stored cold (they just reheat them when we order). Also, the bathroom is only available on the first floor.

Nice cafe with great ambience. Not too crowded so it's suitable for studying. The food is average but the tea is delicious. Definitely will go back here. The place is quite hidden, in the 2nd floor of a building.

It is located on the second floor of Wikacell on Soekarno Hatta street. It's a cozy place to work, study, or just hangout with friends. Menus are varied and reasonably priced. There is a toilet on the first floor and a prayer room on the third floor. Overall this cafe is very comfortable.

It's still in the Kayutangan Heritage section, although it's a bit out of the way. But it's better here, the ambiance is nice and not too crowded. In the center of Kayutangan Heritage, you can't expect it because it's crowded with people, I can't enjoy it if I am (the part of the street with lots of lights)

The place is spacious and clean, food and drinks are affordable too. Prices listed include tax. Friendly and prompt service. Try the Teh Tarik, it's really fresh and not too sweet. The toast is small in portion but delicious too. Top really. There are selling heavy food, Nasi Jeruk but I didn't try it.

Hopefully it can be crowded as well as other cafes in the center of Kayutangan Heritage.

Kopte merupakan cafe baru yg terletak di sepanjang Kayutangan Heritage. Letaknya yg strategis mnjadi kelebihan cafe ini. Tempat parkir cukup luas soalnya sudah ada tukang parkir nya. Suasana cukup nyaman meskipun agak panas karena tidak ada AC. Pelayanannya ramah dan cepat. Harga tergolong murah karena berkisar antara 13k keatas. Menu andalan tentu saja kopi tarik dan teh tarik yang rasanya khas karena dibuat langsung fresh. Juga bisa lihat proses pembuatannya secara langsung. Overall recomended buat yg mau ngopi murah di sekitar Kayutangan.

‚Ä¢ Sorry I didn't take a photo of the drink, because it's really basic, really plain glasses don't have letterhead like the one on the branding
‚Ä¢ As for the taste, it's really delicious, a type of tea that's bitter and not too sweet, the process of making it is really pulled between one cup and another
‚Ä¢ the cup size is also regular, so for those who like to be thirsty or usually with large portions, it's not recommended, there's no large size
‚Ä¢ I suggest that please give the characteristics of screen printing on the plastic cup, because if it's plain, it doesn't make any difference from tea, it's 5,000 on the side of the road, especially at a price of 15,000 and above"

The white nuance, which is also obtained from the fence, some of the furniture, and the door and window frames, makes Bataputi Coffee House a clean and attractive photo backdrop. Coupled with a beautiful cafe environment, surrounded by trees and ornamental plants from the outside to the inside, Bataputi Coffee House has remained as a favorite cafe in Malang since its establishment in 2015.

Many potential photo backgrounds at Bataputi Coffee House. The most favorite is the outer part of the cafe, which has white rattan tables and chairs. We can take photos with 3 backgrounds at once: a wooden gazebo which is part of the smoking area, the Bango River and the trees on its banks that divide Araya Housing, and the magnificent Araya Bridge. Now the chandelier that adorns the Araya Bridge lights up brightly before night falls. Not only does it add to the coolness of your photo background, but it also makes the night atmosphere warm and romantic!

Just open every day at 3 pm, on weekends Bataputi Coffee House starts to get busy at 5 pm. Visitors generally aim to sit in the gazebo and non-smoking rooms that are air-conditioned and have sofas. Besides being a fun place, the food and drinks offered by Bataputi Coffee House are affordable. We tasted two coffee drinks recommended by the friendly cafe staff, namely avocado coffee and the other which is only available on weekends, es kopi susu tempo doeloe.

The coffee in avocado coffee is still quite dominant even though it is served with vanilla ice cream. So if you like light coffee, the creamy tempo doeloe iced coffee is more suitable. Moreover, the special thing is that this milk coffee ice is served with market snacks, the types of which depend on availability.

Heavy meals range from pizza, burgers, to rice, pasta and noodle based ones. Afternoon is the right time for snacking, so we ordered two snacks that cost around tens of thousands of rupiah: fried bananas, gula Jawa and onion rings. The onion rings are crunchy and delicious to eat warmly. However, you must order the Javanese sugar fried banana, which is not sprinkled with meises and cheese as usual, but in a traditional style with a sprinkling of brown sugar and young coconut.

Bataputi Coffee House
Jl. Araya Megah No. 9, Araya City, Malang
Open: Monday-Sunday 15.00-23.00 WIB

One of the best cafes in Malang to relax, unwind, and be close to the nature. It's really difficult finding a caf√© that has a good view and not just fake plants inside the building for pure decorative purpose. Bataputi has a wide selection of food & beverages, and in my experience, they all taste good.

Prices are reasonable, staffs are helpful. Wifi could be improved a little bit, especially in the outdoor area. But all in all, a perfect choice for a 'me time' or to hang out with friends and family.

To be honest I was a bit unsure to come to this place until last month. It was driven by the fact that lots of eatery and coffee house were open offering merely their good look.
Bataputi, however, indeed has good look especially for its interior and location by the river bank,and offers great food. I find the basic menu, such as fried rice, satisfactory. The fresh ingredients and combination of spices bring the savor everyone is looking for. Should one need to indulge in some comfort food accompanied by friendly coffee while enjoying afternoon breeze, Bataputi is the one to visit. The best time to be here is from 3-6 p.m.
The prices might be higher than average around Malang but it worth the money spending for.

Cozy place to hangout, meet up with friends. Banyak pilihan kids friendly

Nice place.

The solution for relaxing coffee, doing assignments, and working in a very different atmosphere from the others! everything is semi outdoor with a nice breeze. the furniture uses used goods like the name of the shop, Lowak. of course still very comfortable.
the location is in the Joyosari area, for girls you know the Prabujaya clothing store, right in front of it. for guys, you know MakPar, it's close to MakPar.

uh for the price? Don't worry, it's guaranteed to be really affordable, starting at 6,000-14,000 (hopefully my memory isn't wrong). for sure it won't drain the bag even if you order it repeatedly hehe.

flavor? even though the place seems very simple, it feels like it can really compete. lots of unique ones like Lowak Ice, I think it's because everyone will have a different review hehe.

capacity? wuuu spacious place, often also for events. can accommodate up to 60 people.

In fact its location is in the middle of a village. You need to be very meticulous to find it. The house seems to be an old one, the one that hasn't gone through much renov. It is left almost as its original form. The furnishings are also vintage. The owner or the barrista, I am not sure which, is very friendly young man. I bought its signature, called Iced-Coffee Kane (delicious Iced-Coffee), which is creamy and strong.

One of the small local coffeeshop that makes me impressed. It's because their signature coffee taste differ from another coffeeshop in Malang. They are not only following the trend, but they pay attention to their quality. My favorite is Es Kopi Susu Kane, paired it with a freshly homemade donut. You have to try it.

'Drink coffee at home' is the concept of this place. Built in the barista/owner's own house, the ambience feels so homey, reminds me of my grandpa's home back in my hometown somehow. But still has a little touch of coffeeshop with a small bar in the corner. Has lots of coffee beans, from arabika to robusta. Tried their filtered tolu batak, latte, and es susu kopi (ice coffee milk), tasted good, made with manual machine. For a non coffee drinker, try the Galauincinno ice, their special recipe, a beverage made of milk, coffee, ice, and palm sugar! A unique one, but taste really good! Affordable price, from 5k to 20k.

You will never expect a coffee shop at a quite place like this, is really traditionally and vintage place with many kind of arabica and robusta coffee, you will be spoiled by the whole coffee things

Es Kopi Kane from this coffee shop has special and unique taste. Pricing is standard. Available for take away and delivery service from food delivery app."

One of my favorite place to hangout. Cafe with Scandinavian concept design. The food and coffee is good, i love their lasagna, super duper mouth watering! Big portion with affordable price. Now they also served pastry, pretzel, sourdough etc. The place is clean, nice place for work or just hangout with friends. There are outdoor and indoor area. The outdoor area is so comfy with pool and coffee table with chair, while the indoor area is bright, clean and cozy. The toilet is big and clean.

I really like this place, definitely would come back and be my choice to spend my time to leisure or working. This restaurant concept is Scandinavian themed, from the design, language, choice of food on the menu, and anything in it.

The taste of their food especially the fried rice is excellent, very tasty and lot of beef. The drink is also good. The snacks i bought, french fries, is also good on the sauce. Tha price is fair with the taste and quality. The place overall is also good and well built.

There are plenty of seat, outdoor, indoor, either on first or second floor. Lot of facility is available, toilet, musholla, valet parking for car, etc. The staff is also friendly and kind, and their service is made me satisfied. There's also live music on weekdays night if I'm not mistaken. They also sell bread here, so there's a bakery or patisserie in here.

went here for brunch and it was perfect. The place was great, every single spot is absolutely instagram worthy. Various menu from snacks, desserts and drinks and they're ALL so pretty. Most of the customers come with their friends or family. Or you can just go by yourself, doing some online task from laptop while enjoying some of their snacks

It's a little bit crowded in the weekend, but still can enjoy the good atmosphere. You can enjoy a life music here. For me, I don't really like the atmosphere if want to spend a long day :("

Kouja is instagramable place for you to hang out and gathering with your friends. Has a photobooth. This place is also able to be a venue of the event.

Great new cafe with different concept

The location is a row of cafes.
The parking is wide.

It just seems unkempt. The location is in front of Sarijan Cafe. Very spacious inside, perfect for assignments and meetings.

If you say it's instagramable, in my opinion 7/10 depending on the motto, you have to have flat angels.

Service... it seems the staff is minimal, so it's not optimal, when I went there in the afternoon before maghrib. That's it, there's no food. Drinking is also limited. And the taste of the coffee is not worth the price. I feel like Nescafe ü§≠At that time I was a student and I was there. Why did he say this drink tastes like pop iceüòÖ

There are toilets and mushollah, just like that, I want to go to the toilet and the mushollah is really not clean, heaps of piles of gt. The toilets are clean, the mushollah needs to be cleaned especially for prayer.

If cleanliness is not maintained and the quality of the food is not improved, you are worried that you will go out of business, especially since there are so many cafes around that are much cleaner and cheaper and taste good.

The food is good, the place is nice, but the coffee is so so. Nice place to hangout in the afternoon. It usually super crowded at weekend. The price is super affordable

Nice restaurant within an upscale neighbourhood in Malang.

Foods and drinks are great and delicious.

The ambiance is amazing and it is pretty busy and popular among young people.

Wifi is available even though it's not that good. Maybe because it is prerty crowded even during weekdays.

There's plenty of seats and tables here, indoor and 2 floor, and some outdoor seating. Good variety of menu, and with fair price to considering the place. Free wifi, great service. Their food and drink tastes good too. Parking space is big for car and bike, you pay the fee on the entrance via langsep. There's also a paid photobox here.

This cafe, which is located on Jalan Dieng, is a comfortable place to just do your assignments or hang out with friends and family. The menu itself is quite varied and quite unique. Apart from coffee, milk and tea, there are also snacks such as french fries, potato wedges, chicken yakitori, takoyaki, onion rings. For heavy food is also quite varied. Food prices at Robbuca range from Rp. 18,000 ‚Äì Rp. 35,000 rupiahs. Meanwhile, drinks range from Rp. 8,000 ‚Äì Rp. 23,000 rupiahs. Inside the Cafe there is also a photo booth at a price of Rp. 35,000 can already take funny photos. The advantages of this place are that the cashier who serves is quite friendly and the place is quite spacious. The drawback is that there are few employees so no one cleans the table so if visitors come there are still food leftovers from previous visitors

For friends enjoying coffee, various traditional snacks are served such as brontak tofu, fried bananas, tempe mendoan, and gandos that will add to the enjoyment of your coffee.

I ordered mie goreng and tea., the tea taste really good. Mie goreng was abit salty., next time should try the coffee. I went there before christmas, they put nice christmas ornaments

The atmosphere there is good.
But the food there is not really satisfying. Honey chicken was either over-fried or fried again and the taste is very ordinary. Not going to pay a cafe price for that kind of food quality.
There heritage noodles also taste just like mie goreng from any other street food stores. Sorry to say, taste and potion are better in those food stores.
So, not very recommend to eat there.
However, the coffee is ok.

If you're a morning person, this place may suit your appetite looking for new ideas. It has an Instagrammable view at every corner. There are variety of coffee and food menu when you're looking forward of a big breakfast. The price is in middle range. It's not too expensive nor too cheap as well.

A very cozy place to have a small or deep talk with friends.

The staffs are sooo nice explaining this n that.
The drinks n food are varied

I love the ambiance and the friendly waiters, the avocado coffee was superb, the summer on the snow (drink) was so fresh and not to sour, although the fettucine carbonara a bit dry not creamy. The price is on the higher side. Oh they didn't turn on the air conditioning on the 2nd floor before 12pm but when i came to visit it's not a hot sunny day so there not much problem, but if it's hot outside it's definitely gonna be a trouble.

You can try to relax with friends/girlfriends. But it's a shame to go there because I just don't know what the menu and the place are. But it's a pretty cool place. And for the menu, because I happened to be there after eating, I just wanted to ice it so I didn't try the coffee. The snacks are pretty good too. It may be a confused choice to have coffee and spend time around there because there are many choices. Oh yes, the minus here is that there are a lot of buskers at night, so you have to be prepared for a lot of change.

Nice. On the edge of the rice fields, unfortunately the fields are not visible because it is night. The coffee is bali and there is gayo. The price is according to the pocket, it doesn't break. Various snacks and there are noodles. Saturday night and Sunday night it's crowded.

A decent place to cob for coffee and hang out looking for ideas to build a nation.

For assignments, thesis, studying, it's really suitable because it's not as crowded as the cafe next door
The pastries taste standard and the prices aren't overpriced
The french fries are delicious
Maybe it's a bit disturbed by the traffic because the location joins the photo studio

Actually it could be 5 stars, but when it came at the same time as the event in the air-conditioned room. The plan is to have fun but it can't be done, it's the same. The outdoor part is hot because unfortunately it's hot this afternoon.
The ice cream is delicious and cheap, much more worth it than m*x*e in my opinion."

There's board game that you can play (like uno and domino), wifi, and power outlet.

Overall it's great, if you want spending time with your collagues or having a place for group work, this is it.

The food presentation is also very nice.
The lime drink is served in a large jug, unlike some resto we visited before. Very generous portion, not too much ice cubes.

The interior is vintage. There is a collection of motorcycles in front of the main entrance. It‚Äôs nice to see if you‚Äôre into bikers. But, I think it took up too much space. The outdoor area has only 2 sets of tables. We chose outdoor because the non-smoking area is not available.

It was our first time and we got a pouch of signature coffee powder for free because we spent more than 250k.
Thank you, Vosco Coffee!

A very comfortable place to just relax or hanging out with bunch of friends accompanied by a delicious cup of coffee. Coffee is good. Food just too pricey. This place differentiates rooms between smokers and non-smokers, this place also provides an IQOS corner.

A comfortable and good place to have a chit chat with your friends in Malang, the coffee and other beverages and also the desserts are all delicious with reasonable price. Though the parking space is not large but overall it's a nice modern coffee shop in town. Inside you may take pictures in interesting spots that have motocycles on display.

Vosco coffee is amazing! The staff. is friendly, the coffee is really good. They have their own coffee bean products. Ambience is nice and cozy, the dish is quite delicious, they have single origin coffee and brewed by the professionals. It's really recommended for coffee lover when visit Malang city.

The first impression begins with the conversation from the host, who happens to be the processor, who explains smoothly and never gets tired of inviting his visitors to visualize a little how coffee from Kawi is processed and served with a quite unique taste!

Apart from serving good coffee according to personal opinion, the hospitality and serenity at this place have become one of the ""escape"" and ""hidden gems"" among shops in Rajekwesi, Wilis, Malang City.

Come here every morning at 7 on Sunday-Tuesday for ""NgoPag"" and have a light discussion about the coffee served

People really like to chat and share about whatever they can, so it's also suitable to ask them questions about coffee while looking for new experiences.

I don't know why if I look on Maps it closes at 23:00. But, me and my friends want to try new vibes. Eh, it turns out that at 8 it's already closed + I ordered it just arrived 10 minutes... For the coffee, it doesn't offer anything different from other coffee shops. Be better.."

The ambiance at Golden Sand is comfortable, warm and calm. Interior design is also suitable to be combined with buildings that are indeed Dutch heritage.

For food, the portions and prices are standard and reasonable. As for the taste, it's also delicious, there's nothing to complain about.

Waiter service is also very friendly and smiling. Big applause for the waiter and the barista.

My only complaint might be the different prices between the menu and those on the bill, for some foods the price can go up 10-25k from what is on the menu book. For drinks, it can actually be 2-5k cheaper than the menu book. Maybe the menu book can be updated so that customers can be more comfortable.

Overall, still a great place, great food and great ambiance. Will I come back here? Of course! The comfortable atmosphere succeeds in making me want to come back to taste other dishes. But for now 4 stars first, if there is improvement in the future, 5 stars for sure!

Oppa is a new coffeeshop in the center of Kayutangan Malang. The products range from coffee to non-coffee, as I recall there are also snacks and rice bowls. The place is not too big but comfortable. Taste is ok too. The plus point is the price because it's really cheap! The medium size coffee milk is only 12k, the portion is like a large one, especially the L size, you will be more satisfied.

Now try it, because I've never tried it before. why order this one because the color is unique hehe. Honestly, I don't know what Folks Blue is, but when you drink it, it tastes taro, vanilla and a little blueberry all together. For the cheese itself, I think it's inferior to the Folks Blue because it's really sweet, the boba is smaller than what I usually order elsewhere. but it's still delicious when bitten like that hehe. Even though I think it's really sweet, it's still delicious to drink

Is one of the Cheese Tea booths which is quite popular in Malang City. There are various cheese tea drink menus available, and the prices are quite affordable. For purchases, you can take in or through the ojol application. because it is only in the form of a booth / stall, the place to stop is very limited, and the parking space follows the existing stall. There are no toilets or prayer rooms available. Even so, now Cheese Tea is quite popular with young people.

Always trust your guts when it tells you not to visit some place. Once I ignored and I got this unpleasant experience. Place a bit fancy, but not with their food and beverages. Coffee's no good at all, and I got undercooked rice on my meal (and they took forever to served it). I didn't bother to complain because I was too exhausted. Definitely will not coming back.

New coffeeshop in town. I tried Cappuccino Royal (double shots capp) with 20k for the price and I would give 7,8/10 for the taste. The location was so strategic and kind of hectic to find a parking place, but not that hard. They have many menus with affordable price, and snacks. Also has 2 floors and their good services would made me to come back later!

Not bad, there were a lot of food and beverage options and they tasted quite decent for such a little place. Interior is excellent, however the only downside is the small parking area which can be pretty dangerous since it is close to the busy main road.

Best bingsoo i‚Äôve ever tasted! My favorite one will always be their strawberry cheesecake bingsoo. Cost around 40k rupiah to get this bowl of sweetness which can be eaten by 1-2 person. Make sure to pick the right time to come here, because usually they‚Äôre full and there‚Äôs a waiting list (especially on the weekend).

Super ecstatic to have an authentic bingsoo place in Malang. I mean the bingsoo that usually being sold in my hometown usually the cheap version. But Timtong elevated it close to the actual bingsoo supposed to be.

It was delicious, the ice shaved is so soft and creamy because it was made from creamy milk and processed using the real bingsoo machine. The red bean on my Azuki Matcha is also royal. I mean they gave me lots of it so it is guaranteed you‚Äôre gonna be satisfied to have one bowl of shared bingsoo here.

The single serving is actually for 2 portion and the sharing serving can be enjoyed by 3-4 person. The price is affordable. Place is comfy but too small and often had long queue. The sweetener is using honey. Anyway they also sell refreshing drinks and tea which are also hard to miss.

I will definitely go back here and recommend this place despite its well-known association with the Masterchef winner üëÄ

great coffee, they have in-house roastery, and you could buy roasted coffee beans there, and ask them to grind it if you didn't have grinder at home. the only minus for me, is the mushola looks so dirty, and hidden in the 2nd floor, and didn't really well kept & clean

Great place to enjoy coffee, and have a snack.  Comfortable seating for gatherings with friends and family.  We can also buy coffee beans/powder produced by Kawisari.

couple month ago my frend tell me about coffe he bring from this shop and say ""the taste is nice and intruguing"" ..so today i visited this shop.. and ""yes"" it was..and ""more""..
this.. i think is proper benchmarks about coffe shop, not just coffe and place for hang around,  this place give proper combination about mood, vintage place, vintage coffe, proper serving attitude,  proper  knowledge, proper chat until hit your levels of coffe geeky-ness.
i stand to say this ""don't let your mind limited your curiosity just because intimidating aura of atmosphere"", the serving attitude in this place just sublime, is proper and nice to everyone..today i came with parfume ""reek de sweat"" and they just serving me with nice, good, kind of servings
so.... 10/10 stars for coffe shop , and serving attitude 20/10.

Iconic coffee place in the heritage area of kajoetangan.

It's on the main road with busy traffic.

Coffee was good, we tried the signature one.

I was tried malbourne iced coffee but the taste is too milky(?) but not bad. So-so. Cold brew nya enak! They gave us best services and the owner was so kind tho. Karena hari pertama, tempatnya rame bangetttt dan camilannya masih sedikit juga. I would recommend this place to you!‚ú®

Nice industrial vibes and nice grounded coffee blend

One of the cafes in Suhat is located next to the Sahid Montana hotel.  This cafe is not too wide but very homey.  The table provided is enough for groups and alone.  The menu offered is interesting, tastes good and has many choices.  Chocolate and coffee based drinks are highly recommended.  For snacks I recommend churros and fries.  One thing that is a little annoying for me personally, sometimes too many people smoke, so the smoke gathers until the table and my clothes smell of cigarette smoke, for passive smokers like me, it's quite disturbing.  Maybe there needs to be another way and regulation to handle my complaint.  thanks.

First of all, nice interior concept, just like an old gold mining site. I drank their coldbrew and it tastes great, mild and fruity. Next time I'll go there, I'd love to enjoy my coldbrew without an ice cube, it might taste a lot better. Overall, as a newcomers, they offer a great Australian culture coffeeshop. You should go there.

Have been trying their several different menus and here's my top three so far:
1. Iced hojicha; it's creamy and thick, the flavour is quite deep, not overly sweetÔºçjust a perfect bittersweet combination
2. French fries with this yellow sauce and mozzarella (I forgot the actual name in the menu üòÇ); because cheese will never be wrong!
3. Beef kebab; the sauce is exceptional!

Unfortunately, I can't give any review about their coffee because tbh my body cannot 'cooperate' at all with any coffee intake, but I can still say this is a nice place to spend the time. The place is not really wide but it's super cozy and calming„Éºsuch a perfect workspace. Not too crowded but it's not empty either. Staffs and owner are very humble and friendly, and they will explain anything if you ask them about the menu. I had a really good time here, and I won't be hesitating to visit this place again and try their other menus!"

Lowokwaru, Kota Malang, Jawa Timur 65144, Indonesia","cafe, store, point_of_interest, food, establishment",4.4,619,1,"This cafe is located in Merjosari, to be precise, next to the Merjosari park alley, Malang City. I went to this place because I got together with my friends with scholarships from UIN, UM, and UB to discuss work programs. Here not only serves various kinds of drinks and snacks but also facilitates reading books, visitors who come can spend their time enjoying the meal while reading the books that are neatly arranged on the shelves. In my opinion, the service is pretty good, the taste of the drinks is also pretty good, and the prices are also right from 8 thousand to 20 thousand, it's just that in my opinion the place is not comfortable. The chairs were not neatly arranged after being occupied by other people and the table still had traces of the drink from the previous visitor.

This coffee shop is so well-known arround the students in Malang because this place's included as the most productive coffee shops for discussion and another agendas. It's also commonly called as Gusdurian (a group of people who follow the value of Gus Dur, 4th President of Indonesia) basecamp and also the place for meeting and discussion by another communities tho. There are many books in the first floor, and it's actually has 3 floors. This place is not only sold the coffee, but also tea, milk, hot chocolate and so on.

this place live up to its name. it provides light drinks, coffee, and small snacks. there's a decent public library, means you don't need to worry if you forgot to bring your books. wifi are also available if you're in for some productivity tasks. parking is not shaded and it's on the side of the street directly. may not suitable for dating, but best for group discussion.

EDIT: several days ago I went back and found out if you want to do events here you need to secure mininum purchase of several hundred thousand rupiahs. If you cannot do that, they charge you additional money. But not all the menus are available for us to purchase. Most of them are sold out, but they don't care if we couldn't reach the mark, we still need to pay the money. How could we fulfill their minimum purchase, if we cannot order anything? I lowered my points from 4 to 2. Still a good place, but not recommended for meeting.

I went here for a casual meeting with my friend. They ran out of the snack and meals. I could ordered iced taro only. The price was cheap. I was surprised the photo in the Google maps didn't match the reality. The place was kinda dirty. They might haven't mopped the floor for a really long time. There were thick layer of dust above the books on the shelf. I was having my drink in the rooftop. The rooftop was dirty and kinda dark. There were only one or two light bulbs. The toilet was in the second story, it was really smelly and disgusting. Poorly maintained place.

It's really nice to hang out here actually, especially if you host a discussion event or simply want to meet people and talk upon some issues in depth. For this oase cafe regulars are activists and intellectuals.

I was hosting a discussion event inviting some groups several days ago. The management charges us 210k rupiah for minimum purchase.

What really disappoint me is:
1) they didnt explain that there will be minimum purchase before the d-day
2) I was and am really okay with the minimum purchase, it's small amount of money. I was really sure the crowd will exceed the minimum purchase by ordering several drinks and food. BUT THEY ONLY SERVED DRINKS. THE MEALS ON THEIR MENU WERE NOT AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT YET THEY STILL INSIST FOR US MAKING IT TO MINIMUM PURCHASE
(how could you expect your customer to order a bag of air or a plate of disappointment and inconvenient and swearing never come back there again smh)
3) They even didn't let us start our event until we make it to minimum purchase. I do understand that your company pushed you hard to meet our obligation as client, sir. But please: you should have informed me before the d-day and providing solving to the situation too!
4) I was complaining to the management after the event finished, they told me that IF I DIDNT MAKE THE MINIMUM PURCHASE, I HAD TO GIVE THEM THE SPARE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CHARGED US.
Excuse you, sir, but your company fail to cater us the food you promised to serve. And you expect us to get our money for bags of air and plates of disappointment. Thank you.
5) We did make it to the minimum purchase. Although I had to pay for some orders they served wrong.

It is never about the amount of money for me. It is the hospitality this caf√© fail to provide. I have charged for bigger amounts of money at another caf√© and I was really happy. Definitely will not come back."

Well, this place is not so spacious though. It's rather small for a cafe located downtown. But as long as you come at the right hours where the crowd is considerably minimum, then you will get a nice ambience instead. Meanwhile, as usual, I tried their latte. It was good enough. But their platter which consists of fried broccoli, kind of mushroom, potatl wedges and fried tofu was incredible. It's tasty and the sauce has some kind of unique sweet taste.

Visit this place after it got promoted by a local IG food reviewer. Nothing's special about this coffeeshop. Price are a bit expensive for that size of coffee. Dish needs forever to be served. Can't find a non-smoking table, unless those one outside.

I like the ambience, the drinks are great. I ordered strawberry creamy and ice coffee mantra. The strawberry creamy is basically like strawberry milk with the exact sweetness based on my likes. The ice coffee mantra, which is specialty in this cafe, but I think isn't special because the taste is like basic ice coffee milk *imo*.
The place is great for hang out with your friends, but not really great for those of you who want to be alone, because it's pretty crowded.

Location: 5/5 (easy to find.)
Place: 3/5 (great interior, I like the wall painting and painting in a frame, very creative. But I think, the cafe should put more ventilation, because sometimes customers are smoke in the indoor room. I found it pretty stuffy for indoor room)
Price: 4/5 (affordable prices according to the quality of the food)

Aesthetic place with limited menu to choose. Food is fair-priced considering the quantity and taste. Air circulation is problematic if you sit inside in a humid, hot weather and smoking area is basically everywhere. Waiter, cook, and barista are all very welcoming. Worth the visit with group of friends, but not intimate place for couples.

Atmosphere ok strategic lovation but sometimes too noisy due to semi open air and the traffic but the menu, taste and variety are good

A great place to hang out with friends and family! Food and beverages vary, the price range from 20-50 thousand rupiah. At that time I ate fish and chips and green tea, it tastes good and quite filling. Because it is located at a crossroads, so the view is pretty good. There was live music too until about 11pm, and it was very entertaining.

The place is nice, cozy, and clean. The menus are affordable and taste really good, although it may take some time (30-45 minutes) per menu to be served. It's a good place for having online work/class, or even family gatherings

Nice place to havr a dinner..they offer some kind of traditional food and drinks.. i ordered Jahe kencur gula merah, alang2 tea with rosella, rawon blonceng and noodle. Im so happy to find they serve the drinks with the real herbs fulfilling the glass..looks so authentic and traditional..i like the alang2tea with rosella at the most, the scent and taste is so refreshing and healty feels..
Rawon is okay but the noodle taste better. I think i will come back to try another food"

One of my favorite place to hangout. Cafe with Scandinavian concept design. The food and coffee is good, i love their lasagna, super duper mouth watering! Big portion with affordable price. Now they also served pastry, pretzel, sourdough etc. The place is clean, nice place for work or just hangout with friends. There are outdoor and indoor area. The outdoor area is so comfy with pool and coffee table with chair, while the indoor area is bright, clean and cozy. The toilet is big and clean.

I really like this place, definitely would come back and be my choice to spend my time to leisure or working. This restaurant concept is Scandinavian themed, from the design, language, choice of food on the menu, and anything in it.

The taste of their food especially the fried rice is excellent, very tasty and lot of beef. The drink is also good. The snacks i bought, french fries, is also good on the sauce. Tha price is fair with the taste and quality. The place overall is also good and well built.

There are plenty of seat, outdoor, indoor, either on first or second floor. Lot of facility is available, toilet, musholla, valet parking for car, etc. The staff is also friendly and kind, and their service is made me satisfied. There's also live music on weekdays night if I'm not mistaken. They also sell bread here, so there's a bakery or patisserie in here.

went here for brunch and it was perfect. The place was great, every single spot is absolutely instagram worthy. Various menu from snacks, desserts and drinks and they're ALL so pretty. Most of the customers come with their friends or family. Or you can just go by yourself, doing some online task from laptop while enjoying some of their snacks

It's a little bit crowded in the weekend, but still can enjoy the good atmosphere. You can enjoy a life music here. For me, I don't really like the atmosphere if want to spend a long day :("

I love with the interior, chill and calm.. My fav tea is the one with lychee and rose flowers. Unfortunately the menu variations is not much..but if you wanna try Korean food, Seoul Scent just right next to this cafe..

Went there when they have ‚ÄúSarapan Gratis‚Äù promo and everything was soooo good üòç

Hidden gem that are not too busy, with carefully crafted menus.

Nice place, aesthetic in all parts indoor & outdoor, for drink I like sigurih the most. When I went there, it was cloudy and then after a while it started to rain. While the indoor area is not that wide, so there are some visitors who take shelter outside, I suggest it would be even better if the indoor area was expanded.

Also, when I ordered a cheese cake, the cashier said it was available, so I paid for it, but after a while she said it was sold out. Finally I ordered another cake and the cashier said the change would be given to me later but she didn't give it to me until I finally asked for it myself as I was planning to leave.

So please improve the service again, and hopefully it will get even better on my next visit, but overall this is a great place üòÖüåø‚òï

Motorcycle parking is at the backyard of this cafe, enter through the small alley next to this cafe. I don't recommend you to bring your car, since they don't have any proper parking for cars.

They have tropical-industrial decoration, really like cafes in Canggu, and the coconut tree there really fits with the vibe. They sell mainly non-alcoholic drinks, but they provide cold beers as well. Kinda pricey if it's compared with any other cafe in Malang, but still reasonable. Definitely a must visit if you have an occasion in Malang.

Good vibes cafe. The only constraint is hard to fine car parking here. So my suggestion if you wanted to come here, just bring motorcycle or public transportation.
Food taste is good, very nice vibes üëåüèª homey and nature

Good food, good place, good service. Cafe with homie vibes

Unique ambience with a hint of archaic vibe. Reasonable price, all menus that we tried was delicious. Nice place to hang out. The place was a bit difficult to reach though.

One of the best cafe in malang to hang out with. The environment and atmosphere was good, And they are also serve beer and good quality coffe. But it‚Äôs lil bit hard to find a car park"

P.S DC's Choco is definitely my favourite. Not too sweet for someone who doesn't like sweet things.

The place is clean, beautiful and has big parking lot. They have place to eat there too. The cake is delicious, ready from small size medium until big. Nice place

Nice place. Every Monday & Tuesday you can get buy 2 get 2 for chocolate praline... And they decorate it very well and stunning.

The food is good, the place is nice, but the coffee is so so. Nice place to hangout in the afternoon. It usually super crowded at weekend. The price is super affordable

Nice restaurant within an upscale neighbourhood in Malang.

Foods and drinks are great and delicious.

The ambiance is amazing and it is pretty busy and popular among young people.

Wifi is available even though it's not that good. Maybe because it is prerty crowded even during weekdays.

There's plenty of seats and tables here, indoor and 2 floor, and some outdoor seating. Good variety of menu, and with fair price to considering the place. Free wifi, great service. Their food and drink tastes good too. Parking space is big for car and bike, you pay the fee on the entrance via langsep. There's also a paid photobox here.

This cafe, which is located on Jalan Dieng, is a comfortable place to just do your assignments or hang out with friends and family. The menu itself is quite varied and quite unique. Apart from coffee, milk and tea, there are also snacks such as french fries, potato wedges, chicken yakitori, takoyaki, onion rings. For heavy food is also quite varied. Food prices at Robbuca range from Rp. 18,000 ‚Äì Rp. 35,000 rupiahs. Meanwhile, drinks range from Rp. 8,000 ‚Äì Rp. 23,000 rupiahs. Inside the Cafe there is also a photo booth at a price of Rp. 35,000 can already take funny photos. The advantages of this place are that the cashier who serves is quite friendly and the place is quite spacious. The drawback is that there are few employees so no one cleans the table so if visitors come there are still food leftovers from previous visitors

This cafe is very good. They sell a lot of traditional bakery and milk. Don't worry the price is cheap.

came here because one of my friend suggested to try this place. it was good. the ambience was the typical coffee shop with bustling sounds of people hanging out with their friends or clacking sounds of people working from the cafe. the food came out good, but not that tasty. the food was a bit expensive, if I must say.

AADK is a high class concept! One of the best cafe where keeps an indoor and outdoor area. The ambience of the first floor is very suitable to create a warm friendship, sharing love and laugh.

The chicken fingers (?) were also very crispy & tender, suitable for snacking. The dogs are super playful, don't bite at all, & help you to relieve your stress by playing with them. The staffs were also very humble & kind, they were willing to share many details about taking care of dogs, dogs breeds, etc. I definitely will back here!

A place where you can play with 12 dogs (big and small size dogs). The dogs are all cute and easy to play with. The food was decent but takes very long to come out. The staff was very helpful. You can take pictures with the dogs and the staff will gladly help out. Will definitely come again.

If you like dogs üêï üê∂ üê© this is the caffe for you , There are approximately 10 dogs from different type , Chihuahua , German Shepherd, etc . The dogs are friendly , cute, and clean. You‚Äôll have to spend 30k minimum so as to enjoy selfies with dogs. The beverages and food  options are okay. Some of the items are pricey compared to other caffe in Malang but yeah maybe the cost of taking care of dogs are included üê∂ üòÄ. Visit and Enjoy , Recommended.

The dogs are cute, well behaved. Really enjoy interact with them. Need to buy 30k/person in the menu to play with the dogs. The foods taste was so so.

Good Place in Malang for the kids.
Brilliant place actually !!

Dog was friendly, and the food is nice.
When i was there some food wasn‚Äôt available.

However the place need a little bit maintenance. Some touch up and clean up the place a bit will be great.

Beware of the dog was not potty trained.
So sometimes you‚Äôll got ‚Äúsuprise‚Äù pee here and there."

The pecel stall is very clean. The seller's mother is friendly. The pecel portion is just right, the taste is delicious. There are also other additional side dishes. It's right in front of the gas station.

This place sells pecel in the morning and STMJ in the evening. STMJ or a mixed drink of MILK, EGG, HONEY and GINGER is priced at a low price of only 12,000 Rupiah. Besides STMJ there is also a toast menu. It's a perfect match. Drink STMJ and Toast at night. For those of you who like half-cooked free-range chicken eggs, you can also order at this place. The location is also easy to find because it is on the side of the main road and is included in an area that is often passed by

The taste of ordinary pecel is delicious, there are a variety of side dishes and drinks. The food is fresh, the vegetables are fresh, the food looks clean and attractive. The price is affordable. I eat pecel with a side dish of skewered meat, the meat is delicious, I think the pecel is a little less salty, or maybe it's typical for pecel to be served like that.

It's really worth it bro. Pecel is close to UB. The taste is good although not the most delicious. With a price of 10k and quite filling. Very suitable for backpackers who are more economical spending. Oh yes, additional side dishes are also available at various prices but still cheap. The thick omelet is only 2k.

It comes to my astonishment that they offer a quite tasty meal but cheaper than any other restaurants or cafes. Good job!

nice place, you can get fresh air n good view there. Recomended place for hangout with friends or couple to spend time in afternoon. There are some less tasty foods and beverage in my opinion like you know sausages in noodle menu and traditional drinks ""rempah-rempah"" the taste less good,but over all is okay...

Very cozy and instagram-able place! I guess mostly 'Kera ngalam' (Malang's youth people) knowed this place, because i got the recommendation from my friend in Malang.

The place are very big and wide. Its near from UMM (Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang) campus. There's outdoor&indoor suite room. For you who loves nature vibes, the outside suite room is really high recommended to chosen.

For the menu, there are a lot of food and beverages popular menu, such as 'Pisang Gigit', 'Roti Bakar', 'Hot Chocolate', 'Coffe beer'. I like the 'Kapiten Coffe Beer', you can drunk that beverages safety because its 0% alcohol even using beer as the mixed beverages with coffe. The taste is delicious also.

I gave 5 star without doubtfull, and i highly recommended you guys to visit this place with your friend for hangin' out when you're visiting Malang City!~"

The staffs are good and helpful, the toilet is clean, and the prayer‚Äôs room is neat and clean (it provides a very fragrant prayer‚Äôs mat and prayer‚Äôs set).

My favorite beverage from this cafe is Milkshake. I didn't find a matcha milkshake for this cafe. When I was a college student, this cafe was always crowded but cozy and quiet.

I recommended Work From Cafe in this place. This cafe must maintain the furniture and interior, but for the taste always be lovely, for waitpersons must smile and be friendly to the customer. BTW, this cafe must pay attention to the plating.

Nice and cozy place and they have smoking (outdoor) and non-smoking (indoor) areas separated. Free Wi-fi and power outlets are available. I think the number of the tables is a little bit small, not surprising because the place is not big. Nevertheless, with the right and nice interiors and light, it feels spacious enough. They apply the new normal protocol so we found that some tables are not in used. I think the chair could be imrpoved, though. I certainly like it if it more comfortable, especially if I want to do my work in the place.
We tried the apple pie, which is part of the pastries displayed at the front counter. It was scrumptious, with the perfect crispy, flaky dough and the right sweetness and sourness of the apple filling. The caesar salad comes as a combination of lettuces, generous amount of grilled chicken, and a slice of garlic bread but with different dressing than the usual yellow caesar dressing I used to know. It uses some kind of mayonnaise combined with certain herbs and spices I think? Kinda tasted the parsley in the dressing somehow. It tasted nice and fresh.
The salted spicy tofu is good, although I prefer mine to be a little bit more salty. It comes with a separate sauce made of sweet soy sauce and chili flakes. The vegetables cream soup tasted good but the texture is somehow quite thick, reminds me of a very thick porridge instead of soup. They're certainly generous with the amount of the vegetables, however.
The chocolate+milk is quite nice, while the iced lemon tea is proved to be a hit for me (definitely want to order it again!). We're lucky enough to get a free ice cream waffle with minimum 100K rupiahs purchase (choose between chocolate, strawberry, or banana one). The strawberry waffle comes with strawberry ice cream, strawberry slices, strawberry jam, and whipped cream that I found very rare used in the waffle sold here in the city. The offer will last until the end of August, by the way.

This place is cozy and classy. You can see yellowish color across the room, so it makes you hungry as soon as you enter the room and almost don't wanna leave it :)) but, if you want to sit comfortably, you may come at afternoon or evening here since this place is too crowded at night. Don't worry about the food and beverages quality, 5 stars are for all menu. Standing applause!

Honestly their interior is a bit off. Their menus are okay but please, if you're in a small indoor place don't put your music volume too loud! Your customers will not get comfy and ended up not buying more of your menus!

the place is comfy. a good place for u, instagram-slave haha. pricey, at least for me. love the toilet. clean. the 2nd floor is to die for. they provide tables with sofas and live music on the 2nd floor. u can also see the night street through the balcony. the food is good. definitely a place for u to hang out

My personal favorite coffee shop in Malang.
The food and drinks I‚Äôve ordered always taste right on my buds.

I fell in love with the place thanks to the sofas area on the 2nd floor. They look a lot like a family restaurant in the west lol! It‚Äôs cute and private. The WiFi is fast and consistent, so you definitely can study, work, or just enjoy your netflix comfortably. I always visited the place in the morning till afternoon so far, and it‚Äôs never been too crowded. Perhaps because I haven‚Äôt stop by at its peak hour.

They accept ovo as well which is good.

It's a two-story cafe so the place is quite spacious. The theme for the 1st and 2nd floor is different, the 1st floor interior looks like a common yet comfy interior you'd find in any typical cafe. The 2nd floor looks like a family dinner place, the other section looks like casual-colorful themed, the terrace is woody-themed [?]

Their drink tastes alright and the pricing is no different than other caf√©s (around IDR 20K and up). We bought a toast and mozzarella stick, hmm... the taste and presentation can be improved.

There's a lot of seating arranged for small to large group. We went there around 8 PM and sat on the 2nd floor terrace. I tell you it's not the best place to enjoy the night. Although the cafe itself located in a strategic place with good parking space, the road is way too busy and noisy for you to hold a proper conversation without raising your voice. Even though the 1st floor music sounds a bit louder, I suppose it's better that way because you'd hear less noise from the busy road."

Nice restaurant within an upscale neighbourhood in Malang.

Foods and drinks are great and delicious.

The ambiance is amazing and it is pretty busy and popular among young people.

This cafe, which is located on Jalan Dieng, is a comfortable place to just do your assignments or hang out with friends and family. The menu itself is quite varied and quite unique.

Pretty much I like the concept, and honestly didn‚Äôt get bore with this cafe. I like working or studying here. Especially in downstairs (even though there‚Äôs not much sitting area)

Industrial concept with a touch of Japanese. They have various kinds of beverages and food. I ordered matcha latte, it was quite good but still it's got more milk than matcha itself.

Best place to hangout and get coffee and be comfortable enough to do assignments at. be prepared to struggle over the good spots as they're almost always taken. great place, great food & drinks.

The place is spacious,  they've got two floors. Unfortunately the indoor non-smoking is not that much. Whereas the smoking area is wider. I might say it is a semi-indoor place, because the smoking room is indoor too.

I ordered Chocolate Ciabatta and Tuna Cheese. Really love both of them, flavour and texture wise. The price is also really affordable.

Unfortunately, the second floor is not smoke-free area, so if you are not smoking, you may use the first floor for dine in but with more limited space.

Cozy place to go with your friends. It's not too crowded and noisy, but I think it's kinda not suitable to work/study there. I recommend you to purchase doro putih and doro biru, the best you can get from thereüëç

The food is delicious with aesthetic arrangement and the drink is nice, comes in fairly cheap price start from IDR 30.000. The service is handy and excellent, the employees is kind. The interior and exterior design is artistic and aesthetic, feels like dining in home with family with cozy atmosphere. This place also has games like guitar, uno, and chess. This place also has free WiFi. Suitable for study and work, or if you just want to eat alone in cozy atmosphere. Gotta recommended this place.

Its located on a remote location, but okay

To be honest i didn't know (or probably never know) if i didn't accidently passed this cafe on my way back home. This cafe is pretty decent for  some remote area/place, it has some cozzy sensation thatvyou usually find on high end cafe on Jakarta or its surrounding. Overall this place have all you need for a stereotype cafe.

The only minus that i'm aware of is the location and place. The first, as i already mentioned it's located on a remote area so it will be hard to find for ordinary people. The second one, although just because someplace located on a remote area doesn't mean the place is definitely small and doesn't have enough parking lot, but on this occasion its is. It will be very difficult if you planned to go into this cafe with a car, because there is no dedicated parking lot for car and even if you planned to go with motorcycle, make sure you go with an single motorcycle if you want park on this cafe.

But after all, this place is overally good if you put aside the location an vehicle problem and just i said before, this place have all you need for a stereotype cafe.

A nice hidden place for a cup of coffee and a cozy atmosphere. Great wifi, great ambience, pretty good coffee but a lack access for parking especially if you ride a car. It opens from 10 AM in the morning."

Nice caffee with good d selection of cakes, coffees, ice coffees and teas and small dishes. Life music on Friday. Option to sit outside, enjoy the traffic, the people, the prayers from the mosque accross the street. This is Malang.

Dizzy Coffee.. French Fries IDR 10,000 But PORTIONS ARE MALANG RAYA CHAMPIONS

Wow, I never thought that in the Ciliwung area, Malang, there is really good coffee..

Product: I ordered Es Coffee Coconut, it tasted really good... my friend, who doesn't like coffee that much, took a sip and immediately said ""mmmm yummmm"". That means it's really good because my friend is the most fussy about food and drink.

Price: the price is standard but in accordance with the taste. The price for Ice Coffee Coconut is only IDR 18,000, guys.. French fries are only IDR 10,000 but the portion, Masha Allah, is a lot, guys, and the taste is really good too...

Place: even though I ordered take away but at first glance I saw that the place was quite comfortable for hanging out... and the location is on the side of the road so it's really easy to find.

Service: friendly service, even though I came with flip flops and all black clothes..

Please, those who miss good coffee can immediately attack the place....

The drinks are great

The place is difficult to find a car park. Very roadside location.

For the price, it's still above the lower limit for cafe prices in Malang, yes, but it's worth it because the place is good, bro, the coffee is also good. Price range if I'm not mistaken 15k-30s

The atmosphere is calm even though the roadside is a bit congested and almost always crowded, especially near gacoan, you know how to do gacoan for yourself

The only minus is the space, which is not too big and not too small, while the plus is that there is an individual seat facing the wall. The seats are actually proportional to the overall space, but I personally think it's a bit too small.

The majority of seats are outdoor, indoor non smoking only 1 seat set, I guess.

The service is a little above standard which is good because the standard is actually already good. If you pay using QRIS (QR Code), the qr code is printed specifically for customer transactions, so you don't need to enter a nominal again like in most cafes today.

Thanks for the experience

So-so.. small place, less parking, really standard coffee.. The image of the Capucinno lgs disappears before you drink it and it's not hot at all"

Food weren‚Äôt top notch, as wel as the beverages. Good place for hang out yes, good place for eating? Think again.

great place to hang out, eat and drink with friends. Cozy and clean.Above average than other hangout places in the city of Malang, the price offered is still affordable ranging from Rp. 20,000 to Rp. 45,000 depending on the food you choose.there are indoor and outdoor places, complete with prayer rooms.

came here because one of my friend suggested to try this place. it was good. the ambience was the typical coffee shop with bustling sounds of people hanging out with their friends or clacking sounds of people working from the cafe. the food came out good, but not that tasty. the food was a bit expensive, if I must say.

AADK is a high class concept! One of the best cafe where keeps an indoor and outdoor area. The ambience of the first floor is very suitable to create a warm friendship, sharing love and laugh. There's a photobox there and every corner is so instagramable. The atmosphere of the second floor is really appropriate to engage communication and find solution. There's a space to be a workplace and having intense conversation. The service is good, the menu is also unquestionable, and the price is normal and affordable.

Nice place for work , hang out or sharing. 7/5

Drinks are standard cafe prices but the glass size is quite mini, the taste is okay. There is live music, the number of seats is not too much. The decoration could be even better, the service is sufficient but it's better if the employees wear aprons, it looks cleaner

Nice place, strategic location because it's in the center of a cafe in Malang.. Spacious parking space, so you don't need to be afraid to bring a vehicle, both two-wheeled vehicles and four-wheeled vehicles.. There are toilets too, washbasins for washing hands too available.. Suitable for hanging out with friends, for gatherings during social gathering, or appointments with people..
If the drink is in accordance with the standard per copy throughout the archipelago, it's good for the variety, as well as the taste.. It's almost the same eleven and twelve..
But the food or snacks that were available yesterday, when my friends and I were there,, only toast was available.. And what is unfortunate is that the toast is only available in one flavor variant, namely chocolate meses flavor.. There is no flavor variant another..
Because my friends and I gathered there during the day, so they said the menu for other snacks was not yet available..
So, it's better to just hang out there at night.."

But not with their interior design, so similar with Starbucks. Let's say it's a local Starbucks. It feels like they don't have their own characteristics. Still better for me, since they have excellent staff and their coffee is superb!

After exploring many coffee shops, I found one coffee shop which I think is really worth it for students like us to visit üòÄ.  Nakoa cafe Bondowoso is one of my favorite hangout cafes, it seems I have visited this cafe countless times.  The reason why Nakoa is my favorite cafe is that most of the people who come here are students doing their assignments, so it makes the atmosphere of the cafe calm and not chaotic.  The people at Nakoa also don't care about visitors, so I think Nakoa is really good for me time.  My favorite menu here is the matcha latte üíö.  Apart from the matcha latte, the drinks here are also delicious.  The price is also standard, which is under 25,000.  Apart from selling drinks, here they also sell some delicious food, moreover, the donuts are really delicious and cheap üòÉ.  For those of you who like to do assignments alone, you can really try this Nakoa cafe.

The place so comfy for works both indoor and outdoor, the coffee is great too. WiFi so fast, the staff so friendly, i have a good experience at Nakoa Cafe, just need some improvement to make the toilet clean. Overall is good, i'll come again to Nakoa Cafe. Waiting for the new menu for filling my tummy.

This is a special place for co-working which makes it also a great coffee shop. Italian espresso machine Simonelli makes nice coffees and you feel like being in a sort of modern museum. Really outstanding design....well done!

I think the doughnut is a normal doughnut. It has no speciality, except the price, 9k ü§≠
The coffe was also tasty as normal coffe.
We can freely take a mineral water.

The place is quite large and cozy for having chit chat"

One of the best pesenkopi for its taste from Pesenkopi Sigura-gura and Pesenkopi UM. It won't be enough for the taste. Best. Moreover, the Creamy Milk Coffee Flavor, the best bet.

Serving coffee, snacks and some meals, this is a good place for small gathering with your friends or family members. In terms of pricing, Excelso is on a more expensive side, but customers get what they pay for. Their staffs are very accomodating and will inform you about discounts or special offer. We paid 25K for their frappio (frappucino) with promo code from Line. Wifi is reliable (simply ask Excelso staffs for its password)

One of my best finding in Malang. Suitable for your focus time, nice location, good coffee and barista.

Decent place for working or anything related, they also provide best banana cake in Malang.

Mmmm is one of my favorite coffee shop in Malang. Definitely, they offer you specialty coffee with high quality coffee beans. I usually try their cappuccino with guest beans and also the single origin (both imported or local beans). The ambience is cozy to chill. One of my fav place to chill and work.

Recommended by my friend who said by his/her friend that this cafe serve the best coffee in town

I'm trying manual brew and use import beans from Andrew roastwork

Cant comment anything to this brewer, its 100% solid perfect taste!

and the cookie its very good and cheap, only 10k

Good drink
Good Price

From the outside it looks like an ordinary small cafe, but it turns out to be a very proper restaurant. The interior is super nice and well laid out, clean and tidy, the green tones are really pretty.

The service is very good, you don't have to wait too long for the food & drinks to come out. The ambiance is really nice and makes you feel at home for long. The music played is mostly jazz, perfect for casual conversation.

For food and drinks tend to be pricey. It looks okay, but the taste is really ordinary for that price. The hazelnut milkshake has lots of ice cubes, then the cream itself is half a glass. As far as I know, a milkshake should have milk and ice cream blended together, not hazelnut milk, add ice cubes and then add whipped cream to half a cup. The straws use paper straws, it's good to care for the environment but it makes it hard to drink the cream.

If the latte is okay, served with cookies and sugar separately. It feels great.

Cozy Hangout Place at Sukun

KADO Cafe offers a warm ambience, as well as friendly service. The place is quite spacious and there are also indoor and outdoor areas. Wifi is fast and there are plugs available, perfect for hanging out or working on assignments. I came here when it was just 2 months old. The menu offered is quite diverse, but not too much. It took quite a long time for the food to arrive, around 35 minutes, even though we were the only family dining in. Standard price 20k-50k. For the taste of the food it's not bad, Woku Chicken can be more absorbed in the seasoning, Cordon Bleu can have more portions. Sambal matah tastes fresh. Club Sandwich is on point. Overall there is still a lot that can be improved in terms of taste for KADO Eatery. Always success!

The eggs have been washed first. Every time I buy stmj, martabak, fried rice or all foods made from eggs, I usually don't wash the eggs first so that when cooking, the seller's hands hold the eggs which still have dirt on them. Maybe the reason is that eggs are not easy to stir. But whatever the reason, this of course affects the halalness of the food.
But here the eggs are clean, there is no adhering dirt. It means that the eggs here are holy and unclean. I'm sure STMJ Yassalam is guaranteed to be halal.

Thanks, yassalam, poor poor, actually the taste...the spices taste in the body, the feeling of aches and pains is gone, especially the special one...it's bad luck to drink here...I'm disappointed.

I feel SYAHDU ATMOSPHERE when I enjoy poor coarse coffee at the shop which is located in this small alley.

Because the location is inaccessible to vehicles, it's better to park on the side of the main road or in the main square.

Arriving at the location, we can choose whether we want to sit on the available benches & tables, or take a stool (plastic chair) and find our own seat along the aisle.

Even though the price of the black brewed coffee is affordable (Rp. 4,000), the taste is very authentic. The coffee tastes thick, according to my taste.

If you don't like regular brewed coffee, Kauman also provides a variety of coffee flavors that are more modern and suitable for today's youth."

In fact its location is in the middle of a village. You need to be very meticulous to find it. The house seems to be an old one, the one that hasn't gone through much renov. It is left almost as its original form. The furnishings are also vintage. The owner or the barrista, I am not sure which, is very friendly young man. I bought its signature, called Iced-Coffee Kane (delicious Iced-Coffee), which is creamy and strong.

One of the small local coffeeshop that makes me impressed. It's because their signature coffee taste differ from another coffeeshop in Malang. They are not only following the trend, but they pay attention to their quality. My favorite is Es Kopi Susu Kane, paired it with a freshly homemade donut. You have to try it.

'Drink coffee at home' is the concept of this place. Built in the barista/owner's own house, the ambience feels so homey, reminds me of my grandpa's home back in my hometown somehow. But still has a little touch of coffeeshop with a small bar in the corner. Has lots of coffee beans, from arabika to robusta. Tried their filtered tolu batak, latte, and es susu kopi (ice coffee milk), tasted good, made with manual machine. For a non coffee drinker, try the Galauincinno ice, their special recipe, a beverage made of milk, coffee, ice, and palm sugar! A unique one, but taste really good! Affordable price, from 5k to 20k.

You will never expect a coffee shop at a quite place like this, is really traditionally and vintage place with many kind of arabica and robusta coffee, you will be spoiled by the whole coffee things

Es Kopi Kane from this coffee shop has special and unique taste. Pricing is standard. Available for take away and delivery service from food delivery app."

I ordered their Pot Ayam Kungpao and the amount of chicken dices surprised me. It was a lot. And it tastes great actually. Yet, the star was the butter coffee. It was my first time drinking such a unique and calming coffee. They added some butter into the coffee and when they're blended, it gave some sweet creamy kinda taste. I love it!

Beware of the queue as it gets so long on weekend. Pricewise is cheap as the portion is big. The main dish served at 09.00 but it opens at 07.00 so if you come before 09.00 you have to wait for the dish to be served. Really love the rice pot because i think it only sold here. The kungpao is dominant with sweet taste but really great. I recommend you all to order the milo tarik cause its super great üëçüèª

nice ambicence, like singaporean kopitiam in 80's

Good coffee and teh tarik

Must try the claypot rice, savory and tasty
and kaya toast, the sweetness is just right.

Beware of the crowds every weekend morning.

I don‚Äôt usually give 3 stars rating but i hope this served as a feedback to improve. Was honestly liking the whole ambience of old chinatown neighborhood because it just felt so nice & very down to earth. What gives me not so pleasant is it took too long to serve when there‚Äôs no queue. Ordered butter coffee & somehow it‚Äôs fine just not really my liking. Also ordered kungpao chicken which tastes okay (which for me i think you could do better to make it taste more like kungpao chicken), and the last is mie kwa which I don‚Äôt really fond of‚Ä¶. It just tastes wrong. The noodles are okay, it‚Äôs ordinary but the soup is just ??? I‚Äôm losing the concept of the taste because it‚Äôs herb-y, with the wrong kind of bitter taste in it. I hope you could improve the taste somehow and take this feedback because the place has a good potential !

The ambience is like ""tempo doeloe""

Their kopi butter was good. I like the unique taste. Coffee with butter? Why not
Their food just okay for me

While the indoor area is not that wide, so there are some visitors who take shelter outside, I suggest it would be even better if the indoor area was expanded.

Also, when I ordered a cheese cake, the cashier said it was available, so I paid for it, but after a while she said it was sold out. Finally I ordered another cake and the cashier said the change would be given to me later but she didn't give it to me until I finally asked for it myself as I was planning to leave.

So please improve the service again, and hopefully it will get even better on my next visit, but overall this is a great place üòÖüåø‚òï

For a moment to be alone in this place, it's comfortable place, it's nice food and drinks and peacefull"

Coffee's good, worth the price. Haven't try their food or snacks tho.
Update : Tried a slice of brownies, and it was too dry, seems like no moist is left. Lasagna was okay, but the gravy could be better.

One of my best finding in Malang. Suitable for your focus time, nice location, good coffee and barista.

Decent place for working or anything related, they also provide best banana cake in Malang.

Mmmm is one of my favorite coffee shop in Malang. Definitely, they offer you specialty coffee with high quality coffee beans. I usually try their cappuccino with guest beans and also the single origin (both imported or local beans). The ambience is cozy to chill. One of my fav place to chill and work.

Recommended by my friend who said by his/her friend that this cafe serve the best coffee in town

I'm trying manual brew and use import beans from Andrew roastwork

Cant comment anything to this brewer, its 100% solid perfect taste!

and the cookie its very good and cheap, only 10k

You must go to this cafe once for life

Top notch coffee.
Edgy interior design, a bit small space though.

Parking for car also quite limited, i suggest to park somewhere & take a walk is better."

1. The place is rather small than the other two (maxx and sbux) they only have five tables indoor area and two or three tables outside.
2. Ordered a choco drink (forget the name) and a chicken panini. Taste wise, pretty good and simple, nothing breakthrough tho. Might ordered something else later.

What a great experience of eating Durian! The price was also reasonable and the view was ok. It's giving the new experience to eat Durian and see the Durian trees around, meaning that the Durian is as fresh as we can get!

But the only to improve was on the kpop music that kept played, that was the atmosphere breakerüòÖ

It's located on the hills, so i call this place is embarassing place to take a relax because the sightseeing was beautiful while you get lunch with various recipe, javanese/ traditional recipe with a delicious taste, or you can choose from fried rice, or fried noodle, or lalapan and there are many kind of coffe that you can select.. and of course there are many durian trees, you can choose, taste, pay and enjoy it with your family or your collegues, also you can take away both of the food or durian.. it has big parking area and it has many gazebo.. you also can do reservation first... so try it

Nice place to enjoy sightseeing and be refreshed.. Durian trees are everywhere. Can buy durian and Indinesian food and drinks with reasonable price. We can choose what to eat from many variaties of durian. Monthong or local, both are delicious. There will be a live music available after the stage is ready (under construction). About 30 minutes from Malang. Well, must drive carefully because relatively small streets to reach there (but smooth). Recommended place for durian lovers..

Now try it, because I've never tried it before. why order this one because the color is unique hehe. Honestly, I don't know what Folks Blue is, but when you drink it, it tastes taro, vanilla and a little blueberry all together. For the cheese itself, I think it's inferior to the Folks Blue because it's really sweet, the boba is smaller than what I usually order elsewhere. but it's still delicious when bitten like that hehe. Even though I think it's really sweet, it's still delicious to drink

Is one of the Cheese Tea booths which is quite popular in Malang City. There are various cheese tea drink menus available, and the prices are quite affordable. For purchases, you can take in or through the ojol application. because it is only in the form of a booth / stall, the place to stop is very limited, and the parking space follows the existing stall. There are no toilets or prayer rooms available. Even so, now Cheese Tea is quite popular with young people.

Cozy interior and extensive menu ranging from Western to Asian food. Fun place to spend the weekend with friends. If you sit indoor, the sound of the coffee machine is quite loud - so maybe it's not really comfortable for working.

Good coffee and good food sometimes always comes with the price. Nice ambience for a friendly hangout, or even a closed meeting. But mind you when you looking for this place you might can't find it right away because there's not quite obvious sign.

I went here twice. The first time I went with my sister. We ordered Horenso salad. It was so good, especially the sauce. It was sour, sweet and something that I can't describe. Also the veggies was so fresh.
I also ordered Chicken steak (for me, it was regular chicken steak) but the sauce was yummy and chicken pop. I am not recommended chicken pop. It was hard. Then, for drink I ordered Green Republic. I like it.
The second time ordered Chicken Fajitas. I think they have specialty in sauce. Again, the sauce was superb. I want more the sauceü•≤.
Last but not least was coffee latte. I don't like it. Just like reguler coffe latte that I made in home.
I didn't see if they have baby chair. Maybe you can asked them if you plan with your baby. I saw prayer place for Muslim and the toilet was cleaned.

If you have plan to Fertisoil I recommend the salad and Chicken Fajitas or something that has sauce. They have special sauces in their menu.

i feel like the price is kinda pricey for a cafe in malang. but i like their egg croissant sandwich! that's good. another well designed cafe in malang, i like their minimalistic concept. even though their place is kinda small, but they have non smoking and smoking area, they even have outdoor area. thinking of coming back someday!"

I went to this place because I got together with my friends with scholarships from UIN, UM, and UB to discuss work programs. Here not only serves various kinds of drinks and snacks but also facilitates reading books, visitors who come can spend their time enjoying the meal while reading the books that are neatly arranged on the shelves. In my opinion, the service is pretty good, the taste of the drinks is also pretty good, and the prices are also right from 8 thousand to 20 thousand, it's just that in my opinion the place is not comfortable. The chairs were not neatly arranged after being occupied by other people and the table still had traces of the drink from the previous visitor.

This coffee shop is so well-known arround the students in Malang because this place's included as the most productive coffee shops for discussion and another agendas. It's also commonly called as Gusdurian (a group of people who follow the value of Gus Dur, 4th President of Indonesia) basecamp and also the place for meeting and discussion by another communities tho. There are many books in the first floor, and it's actually has 3 floors. This place is not only sold the coffee, but also tea, milk, hot chocolate and so on.

this place live up to its name. it provides light drinks, coffee, and small snacks. there's a decent public library, means you don't need to worry if you forgot to bring your books. wifi are also available if you're in for some productivity tasks. parking is not shaded and it's on the side of the street directly. may not suitable for dating, but best for group discussion.

EDIT: several days ago I went back and found out if you want to do events here you need to secure mininum purchase of several hundred thousand rupiahs. If you cannot do that, they charge you additional money. But not all the menus are available for us to purchase. Most of them are sold out, but they don't care if we couldn't reach the mark, we still need to pay the money. How could we fulfill their minimum purchase, if we cannot order anything? I lowered my points from 4 to 2. Still a good place, but not recommended for meeting.

I went here for a casual meeting with my friend. They ran out of the snack and meals. I could ordered iced taro only. The price was cheap. I was surprised the photo in the Google maps didn't match the reality. The place was kinda dirty. They might haven't mopped the floor for a really long time. There were thick layer of dust above the books on the shelf. I was having my drink in the rooftop. The rooftop was dirty and kinda dark. There were only one or two light bulbs. The toilet was in the second story, it was really smelly and disgusting. Poorly maintained place.

It's really nice to hang out here actually, especially if you host a discussion event or simply want to meet people and talk upon some issues in depth. For this oase cafe regulars are activists and intellectuals.

I was hosting a discussion event inviting some groups several days ago. The management charges us 210k rupiah for minimum purchase.

What really disappoint me is:
1) they didnt explain that there will be minimum purchase before the d-day
2) I was and am really okay with the minimum purchase, it's small amount of money. I was really sure the crowd will exceed the minimum purchase by ordering several drinks and food. BUT THEY ONLY SERVED DRINKS. THE MEALS ON THEIR MENU WERE NOT AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT YET THEY STILL INSIST FOR US MAKING IT TO MINIMUM PURCHASE

3) They even didn't let us start our event until we make it to minimum purchase. I do understand that your company pushed you hard to meet our obligation as client, sir. But please: you should have informed me before the d-day and providing solving to the situation too!
4) I was complaining to the management after the event finished, they told me that IF I DIDNT MAKE THE MINIMUM PURCHASE, I HAD TO GIVE THEM THE SPARE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CHARGED US.
Excuse you, sir, but your company fail to cater us the food you promised to serve. And you expect us to get our money for bags of air and plates of disappointment. Thank you.
5) We did make it to the minimum purchase. Although I had to pay for some orders they served wrong.

It is never about the amount of money for me. It is the hospitality this caf√© fail to provide. I have charged for bigger amounts of money at another caf√© and I was really happy. Definitely will not come back."

Every time I go home, I always say ""position?

This is, hunger quencher is wrong, anxiety quencher, when I want to snack during the day, I can really come here, the place is comfortable, seblak is delicious (there are lots of other food choices, there's fried rice, what kind of rice was that, what kind of baked rice, then potatoes fried for snacks, lots of it anyway) the price rate is also reasonable, there is a price with taste, FREE WIFI which is clear as a benchmark for the poor for quotas like meüòÖ, and what clearly makes it even more comfortable, there is a prayer room, clean, spacious too. It's all over to Malang, strayed from the starfruit, manganese or Seblak to the nek ae rek, uanek. Original.

The place is comfortable, good for coffee while working on assignments. There is wifi and plugs, so you forget more about time.

My regular place to eat and hang out has moved here, so it's bigger than the government's promise, the food is obviously delicious as good as mother's cooking, fast WiFi can make ZUMA great, there's a prayer room too who knows how to pray, although usually only once during Friday prayers, parking space is also wide. You know, I want to bring a FUSO truck, there are more and more seats, I want an event to invite members of the RT, there are also plugs that can charge electric motorbikes, now I'm also diligent in holding promos, AKA NDANG GASNO MRENE AE LAH COK.

It's comfortable for hanging out while doing assignments with besti ges, in terms of taste and the price is also affordable..
Enihh fresh drink sis

Coincidentally, I got a free voucher for free, exchanged it right away. And it turns out that seblaknya good. If you want to add toppings, it's really cheap, guys, from sausages, chicken, eggs, to seafood like chikuwa, tofu, and salmon balls. Really sucks at it"

Always trust your guts when it tells you not to visit some place. Once I ignored and I got this unpleasant experience. Place a bit fancy, but not with their food and beverages. Coffee's no good at all, and I got undercooked rice on my meal (and they took forever to served it). I didn't bother to complain because I was too exhausted. Definitely will not coming back.

New coffeeshop in town. I tried Cappuccino Royal (double shots capp) with 20k for the price and I would give 7,8/10 for the taste. The location was so strategic and kind of hectic to find a parking place, but not that hard. They have many menus with affordable price, and snacks. Also has 2 floors and their good services would made me to come back later!

Not bad, there were a lot of food and beverage options and they tasted quite decent for such a little place. Interior is excellent, however the only downside is the small parking area which can be pretty dangerous since it is close to the busy main road.

Nice

From food, snacks, to delicious drinks. Indoor and outdoor rooms are available. It can really hang out or even an organizational meeting. There is a prayer room too. The view is great and there are lots of spots for photos. Prices are very affordable for the size of a cafe with good food and a comfortable atmosphere. Really want to come back here again üëçüèª.

the place is nice, there are lots of spots to sit, the waiters are friendly, the drinks are delicious, in my opinion the interior design is also good

I ordered spaghetti carbonara, in my opinion and my friends, the taste was flat, the spices didn't taste, the carbonara was still a bit fishy and not creamy but it really tasted like egg, huh, sorry üòîüôè

One of the coffeeshops in the Dermo area that is a subscriber, the price is cheap and the place is good. For the drink menu, some are delicious and some are ordinary, overall this is a good place. Recommended!"

But why my ordered milk is not hot enough? I ordered hot chocolate milk üò≠ but it just a lukewarm drink. In addition, it's a bit pricey and less tasteful than the milk served in the original place in Batu city. The pros are that there are outdoor seating area and that we can get original fresh milk inside the city.

Small space, fast response and yummy milks. Strawberry, melon and vanilla are recommended flavors.

Just so so. Nothing special with the milk-menus and the side dish

It's cozy, quiet, not many smokers (well, at least when I was there). Good choice to have a quality time but, also a perfect place to work on your paper. The air circulation definitely amazed me. The food is quite good, most of it is good but almost no option for spicy good. The drinks feels so right, so good. Also, this place is spacious, there are indoor and outdoor space and not so crowded, just perfect! Price range from 17k to 30k something. The staff is friendly too, much love‚ú®Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Plus point for their nice, quiet and cozy ambience. But not a fan for what they serve. Coffee taste not so good, and their mashed potato is bland with no creamy taste at all. Or maybe I just pick the wrong dish? Improve your dishes and drink, and maybe I'll consider another visit.

Will definitely be my favourite coffee shop in Malang. The coffee is superb! Try pour over V60 Gayo wine beans. Sooo light and clear. And surprisingly, it's not really expensive for such a fragrant and tasty coffee. The place? So much greeny and peaceful. It's got a concept a vintage house. A house during Dutch colonization. I feel like in my grandma's house in the village.

The second time we comeback here‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è the pancakes was seduced me.
Price really ok for the good pancakes.. 15k for the single basic pancakeüòç
And caramel macchiato üòçüòçüòç pasta was ok. Ricebowl also still worth it..
Cozy place to chill maybe work little bit chit chat.. maybe little bit chill music make this place more cozyü§ó
but one thing little bit bothering me that I had to sit next to active smokers people who smoke all the time even I told him that is bother us.
Cause is writen no where in this room! So disrespecful and 0 tolerant.

Cozy place, nice decor, good ambiance, skillful barista.

Various choices of coffee preparation methods.

When it comes to coffee, I believe most would like to spent their time by sitting back and relax; so in this place. I see groups of friends gather and talk over coffee. They laugh, drink, sing and then go home. Unfortunately, seat with backrest is none to see here.
The coffee is admittedly somewhat nice. The milk is fresh and goes side by side with the coffee is a regular cup. It would be a star when it is served in a bottle, with a brand, in a fridge of a convenient store. The sugar was plenty to keep the older away. Yet the temperature is inviting for the white collars to slow down after work.
In conclusion, this place could have been better.

This place offers manual brew coffee with such affordable price. The place is nice, the people are welcome and humble. Great choice to have a good cup of coffee

Nice clean place although not too big. Easy access to the side of the road, even though from the main road it doesn't look too much like an ordinary shophouse, later there are stairs below for access to nongki & to the swimming pool for the children. The view of the rice fields really likes it if there is a cafe with a view of nature that can be used for healing. Drinks & food are pretty standard prices from 10 thousand-25 thousand. The snack menu has a few choices, try adding union rings, chocolate cheese bananas, crispy tofu, medoan tempeh or cheese cassava. There is no VAT at this time. It's just a shame it opens at 3 in the afternoon. Lack of promotion on social media too. Try near the swimming pool, give a table and chairs with umbrellas like that üëç.

There are several choices of types of coffee (average iced). The system is take away because there are no seats.

One of my favorite place to hangout. Cafe with Scandinavian concept design. The food and coffee is good, i love their lasagna, super duper mouth watering! Big portion with affordable price. Now they also served pastry, pretzel, sourdough etc. The place is clean, nice place for work or just hangout with friends. There are outdoor and indoor area. The outdoor area is so comfy with pool and coffee table with chair, while the indoor area is bright, clean and cozy. The toilet is big and clean.

I really like this place, definitely would come back and be my choice to spend my time to leisure or working. This restaurant concept is Scandinavian themed, from the design, language, choice of food on the menu, and anything in it.

The taste of their food especially the fried rice is excellent, very tasty and lot of beef. The drink is also good. The snacks i bought, french fries, is also good on the sauce. Tha price is fair with the taste and quality. The place overall is also good and well built.

There are plenty of seat, outdoor, indoor, either on first or second floor. Lot of facility is available, toilet, musholla, valet parking for car, etc. The staff is also friendly and kind, and their service is made me satisfied. There's also live music on weekdays night if I'm not mistaken. They also sell bread here, so there's a bakery or patisserie in here.

went here for brunch and it was perfect. The place was great, every single spot is absolutely instagram worthy. Various menu from snacks, desserts and drinks and they're ALL so pretty. Most of the customers come with their friends or family. Or you can just go by yourself, doing some online task from laptop while enjoying some of their snacks

It's a little bit crowded in the weekend, but still can enjoy the good atmosphere. You can enjoy a life music here. For me, I don't really like the atmosphere if want to spend a long day :("

Sauce for the chicken chop is good but oily. Pricing is standard. Good packaging for take away and delivery. Food can be ordered by food delivery app

Ambience and the staffs were okay but after waiting for like 40 mins (which is  long if you ask me) the foods and drinks that came together were all served cold. Not the best option considering the pricing is pretty standard for similar cafes yet my drink tasted nothing like what i ordered. Came here to work on my laptop but the wifi is down and even if they'd work, staffs said the wifi got a time limit for 3 hours. Like??
This was like my 4th time here and before this my experiences were ok if not the best but this would be my last. Won't be coming back again.

Took a long time for the food to come out, no table service so we have to wait for the food downstairs. Ordered some cupped drinks and one of it wasn't sealed properly so it spilled everywhere when carried.
Someone else also took my order without the cashier noticed. Maybe they should have put numbers/names in an order so it's easy to call out the order and no one will mistakenly take other people's order.
The place itself is nice but it's crowded, and sometimes there's a selfish customer that takes table for 4 by themselves.
The menu wasn't updated, I came here for Tacos as they have it on the menu on Google Maps but when I came here, they don't have it. For Malang standard, it's quite overpriced.

wait for approximately 30 minutes and the server ended up saying the food that i ordered was out of stock. coffee milk??? should've named it MILK coffee, barely tasted any coffee.

Even tho SOMETIMES this caf√© kind a have some troubles at the serv, i think they still give what is the best for costumers. Sooo... It's 5 star i guess"

I went to this place because I got together with my friends with scholarships from UIN, UM, and UB to discuss work programs. Here not only serves various kinds of drinks and snacks but also facilitates reading books, visitors who come can spend their time enjoying the meal while reading the books that are neatly arranged on the shelves. In my opinion, the service is pretty good, the taste of the drinks is also pretty good, and the prices are also right from 8 thousand to 20 thousand, it's just that in my opinion the place is not comfortable. The chairs were not neatly arranged after being occupied by other people and the table still had traces of the drink from the previous visitor.

This coffee shop is so well-known arround the students in Malang because this place's included as the most productive coffee shops for discussion and another agendas. It's also commonly called as Gusdurian (a group of people who follow the value of Gus Dur, 4th President of Indonesia) basecamp and also the place for meeting and discussion by another communities tho. There are many books in the first floor, and it's actually has 3 floors. This place is not only sold the coffee, but also tea, milk, hot chocolate and so on.

this place live up to its name. it provides light drinks, coffee, and small snacks. there's a decent public library, means you don't need to worry if you forgot to bring your books. wifi are also available if you're in for some productivity tasks. parking is not shaded and it's on the side of the street directly. may not suitable for dating, but best for group discussion.

EDIT: several days ago I went back and found out if you want to do events here you need to secure mininum purchase of several hundred thousand rupiahs. If you cannot do that, they charge you additional money. But not all the menus are available for us to purchase. Most of them are sold out, but they don't care if we couldn't reach the mark, we still need to pay the money. How could we fulfill their minimum purchase, if we cannot order anything? I lowered my points from 4 to 2. Still a good place, but not recommended for meeting.

I went here for a casual meeting with my friend. They ran out of the snack and meals. I could ordered iced taro only. The price was cheap. I was surprised the photo in the Google maps didn't match the reality. The place was kinda dirty. They might haven't mopped the floor for a really long time. There were thick layer of dust above the books on the shelf. I was having my drink in the rooftop. The rooftop was dirty and kinda dark. There were only one or two light bulbs. The toilet was in the second story, it was really smelly and disgusting. Poorly maintained place.

It's really nice to hang out here actually, especially if you host a discussion event or simply want to meet people and talk upon some issues in depth. For this oase cafe regulars are activists and intellectuals.

I was hosting a discussion event inviting some groups several days ago. The management charges us 210k rupiah for minimum purchase.

What really disappoint me is:
1) they didnt explain that there will be minimum purchase before the d-day
2) I was and am really okay with the minimum purchase, it's small amount of money. I was really sure the crowd will exceed the minimum purchase by ordering several drinks and food. BUT THEY ONLY SERVED DRINKS. THE MEALS ON THEIR MENU WERE NOT AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT YET THEY STILL INSIST FOR US MAKING IT TO MINIMUM PURCHASE
(how could you expect your customer to order a bag of air or a plate of disappointment and inconvenient and swearing never come back there again smh)
3) They even didn't let us start our event until we make it to minimum purchase. I do understand that your company pushed you hard to meet our obligation as client, sir. But please: you should have informed me before the d-day and providing solving to the situation too!
4) I was complaining to the management after the event finished, they told me that IF I DIDNT MAKE THE MINIMUM PURCHASE, I HAD TO GIVE THEM THE SPARE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CHARGED US.
Excuse you, sir, but your company fail to cater us the food you promised to serve. And you expect us to get our money for bags of air and plates of disappointment. Thank you.
5) We did make it to the minimum purchase. Although I had to pay for some orders they served wrong.

It is never about the amount of money for me. It is the hospitality this caf√© fail to provide. I have charged for bigger amounts of money at another caf√© and I was really happy. Definitely will not come back."

Overall, this place is good for you to have fun together in groups and drinks to your liking.

Really lucky i dont give you low stars.. The only thing stopping me is the atmosphere and design also how you have a pool table in good condition, bar service also great.

i love the cafe's interior design, industrial x Scandinavian i think, so Instagramable..
also they have working space too.
they sell coffee beans and roasted by themselves.
i tried the cappucinno, they use arabica coffee for the espresso and it's good.
the minus is the toilet separated with the cafe (sharing toilet) and it's not clean :(

Been trying all their menus, and their signature just the best.
Cozy places divided by smoking and non smoking room.
If you want to find a comfortable, homie coffee shop with no buzz crowded, this just the right place to go.

My favorite spot is in the corner next to their roasting room, on non smoking area or you even can called it coworking space. colokan dimana mana, banyak tanaman. Makanannya enak (they just opened their Aromatic Kitchen).

And their hospitality just the best!

Must try: Late Afternoon and Red Velvet!

Simple. The price is enough to make you full without breaking your wallet, with the right taste. In my opinion, the chili sauce is not enough spicy kick for me who likes jarring spicy.

The advantage of this cafe is that it is located quite strategically behind UIN and the prices are affordable for student pockets, the drawback is that the place is quite cramped

KopiStudio24 has always been my favourite coffee shop in Malang because This coffee shop is open 24 hours hehe. I usually go there with my friend or alone when I want to drink something sweet or want to eat ice cream. The staff is very humble, the place is very suitable for study because there are so many electric plugs available there.
Their drinks menu are great especially the one with the avocado coffee base and milk tea boba, I really love it! This is a good place to chill alone or with friends haha! The another menu were all tasty like the ice cream. There are sooo many flavors to choose from and I recommend the ice cream with mango jam because it tastes so fresh. As for the food menu, I like the cireng rujak seasoning because it's savory and don't forget the sweet pancong with chocolate cheese flavor. But this is less recommended  to come on weekends because it's very crowded and long queues because the place is not too big. Oh, there is also a large prayer room available here!  If you‚Äôre up for a cozy place and affordable price for students then this is a must place to visit. thanks!.

Open 24 hours, offers variety of drinks and snacks. It has an indoor area and also outdoor area. Could be crowded at busy hours. The price is very affordable. The taste is also acceptable.

Tasty and affordable

The coffee is nice. I ordered one Americano on the spot, ordered the creamy ones through GrabFood and they were nice. I have also tasted the snacks like Pancong with Ovomaltine, Cireng and the banana one, and they were nice, especially the Cireng's rujak sauce.

The only thing that matters for me was the rice. I ordered it through GrabFood and found it dried."

Located on narrow alley between Mosque and Church at Alun-alun kota Malang. You will get the special atmosphere on sunny afternoon.

The menu start from IDR 4,000 with various options like coffee, tea, blend, etc. It serves hot or ice. Sometime there's gorengan (indonesian street food) too. The menu is good, especially the Mango drink.

But there's one thing that can make uncomfortable for some people is there are only providing small plastic chair and table, and it placed on the alley's street. So sometimes the local people may passing through and can make uncomfortable.

I feel SYAHDU ATMOSPHERE when I enjoy poor coarse coffee at the shop which is located in this small alley.

Because the location is inaccessible to vehicles, it's better to park on the side of the main road or in the main square.

Arriving at the location, we can choose whether we want to sit on the available benches & tables, or take a stool (plastic chair) and find our own seat along the aisle.

Even though the price of the black brewed coffee is affordable (Rp. 4,000), the taste is very authentic. The coffee tastes thick, according to my taste.

If you don't like regular brewed coffee, Kauman also provides a variety of coffee flavors that are more modern and suitable for today's youth."

Sauce for the chicken chop is good but oily. Pricing is standard. Good packaging for take away and delivery. Food can be ordered by food delivery app

Ambience and the staffs were okay but after waiting for like 40 mins (which is  long if you ask me) the foods and drinks that came together were all served cold. Not the best option considering the pricing is pretty standard for similar cafes yet my drink tasted nothing like what i ordered. Came here to work on my laptop but the wifi is down and even if they'd work, staffs said the wifi got a time limit for 3 hours. Like??
This was like my 4th time here and before this my experiences were ok if not the best but this would be my last. Won't be coming back again.

Took a long time for the food to come out, no table service so we have to wait for the food downstairs. Ordered some cupped drinks and one of it wasn't sealed properly so it spilled everywhere when carried.
Someone else also took my order without the cashier noticed. Maybe they should have put numbers/names in an order so it's easy to call out the order and no one will mistakenly take other people's order.
The place itself is nice but it's crowded, and sometimes there's a selfish customer that takes table for 4 by themselves.
The menu wasn't updated, I came here for Tacos as they have it on the menu on Google Maps but when I came here, they don't have it. For Malang standard, it's quite overpriced.

wait for approximately 30 minutes and the server ended up saying the food that i ordered was out of stock. coffee milk??? should've named it MILK coffee, barely tasted any coffee.

Even tho SOMETIMES this caf√© kind a have some troubles at the serv, i think they still give what is the best for costumers. Sooo... It's 5 star i guess"

I ordered mie goreng and tea., the tea taste really good. Mie goreng was abit salty., next time should try the coffee. I went there before christmas, they put nice christmas ornaments

The atmosphere there is good.
But the food there is not really satisfying. Honey chicken was either over-fried or fried again and the taste is very ordinary. Not going to pay a cafe price for that kind of food quality.
There heritage noodles also taste just like mie goreng from any other street food stores. Sorry to say, taste and potion are better in those food stores.
So, not very recommend to eat there.
However, the coffee is ok.

If you're a morning person, this place may suit your appetite looking for new ideas. It has an Instagrammable view at every corner. There are variety of coffee and food menu when you're looking forward of a big breakfast. The price is in middle range. It's not too expensive nor too cheap as well.

Good for group, easy to find, affordable price. Their coffe tasted good

I was interested to visit this place for I saw plenty parking customers' motorcycles by the fence every time I pass it. Unfortunately what I got on visit was opposite to inviting.

Arriving at this place, this place was pretty empty. It was around 2 in the afternoon. The room design was simple....it is more like dull square chairs and rectangular brown tables. Definitely nothing about its atmosphere attracts people to come. The street at its front was noisy and it is a huge oven with metal roof, ready to bake anyone. Probably it is so since there is no tree around it.

The coffee was actually fine yet it does nothing to reduce the inconveniences. The perfect disaster brought by its french fries. It was served on a plate of 20 cm of diameter and looked slightly wet. When I touched it was really damp, seemed like soaked in cooking oil rather fried. And thanks to the fries bland taste, my disappointment was complete.

I still do not understand the reason people coming back to this place.

nice

Want to chat with friends? But on all gadgets? There's really no wifi here, it's just a really cozy place to chat with friends, it's more fun than hanging out but you're all on your budget, right? cuss already

Cozy place for coffee and hangout. Although the sound of vehicles is a bit noisy, it might be understandable because of the location on the side of the road. In addition to hanging out for coffee at the location, there is also an uno card game, which makes hanging out with friends longer. For those who like to hang out but still hold their cellphone, it might not be suitable because there is no free wifi at the location

The place is nice, nice, friendly, for hanging out with friends, it's also calm for friends... but it's a shame that the one who owns the shop can't win if you play Uno üòÇüòÇüòÇ"

Great coffee shop, deserve more recognition. The Baristas are super friendly and informing, and last but not least, the prices do make sense.

Good place for enjoying aeropress coffee

a good place and good food. the price starts from Rp 10.000 (if I'm not mistaken). it's like a hidden place to relax and grab a coffee and read a book.

A great place to chill with various delicacies. Hmm what else? Calm atmosphere to support your productivity, in case you need a place to do your remote work :D"

great coffee, they have in-house roastery, and you could buy roasted coffee beans there, and ask them to grind it if you didn't have grinder at home. the only minus for me, is the mushola looks so dirty, and hidden in the 2nd floor, and didn't really well kept & clean

but I do highly recommend the smoking / non-smoking room, for a casual or business meeting. I usually visit Labore after 19.00, their night vibe is also lovely.

First of all, I love the taste of the nasi goreng pete they serve. I was surprised to know that the price was reasonable, considering on where it is located.

The kombucha is on point! the chicken is good but the sauce is just average.

its my first time came here. I came here with friends and order a drink and the same food for each of us.. They have a very slow service, our drink was served after 30ish minutes and the food were arrive after one (1) hour. We already go back and forth asking them and they always say that its because the rice is not ready. and we are not the only table waiting in such a loooong time like that.

It is very sad tho, they could learn something about supply chain management and communication between team to prevent this kind of issue.

The service is good, the cashier and one of the waiters are friendly and answer all our questions despite the crankyness we had (hungry due to waiting for an hour).

I like the chicken & kombuca here!

A small local restaurant/cafe with great service, food, drink and overall experience! They have a rooftop and oke bgt waktu senja2 dateng kesini!
Definitely a go-to place for cafe when you are in malang Huge portion of roasted chicken (which is tasty) & side dishes are delicious as well.

A lil bit shocked that malang has a place to drink kombucha in a market. Their kombucha is nice but i think if only they can make it more sweet. Price is not too pricey. Better come in the afternoon

Nakoa cafe Bondowoso is one of my favorite hangout cafes, it seems I have visited this cafe countless times.  The reason why Nakoa is my favorite cafe is that most of the people who come here are students doing their assignments, so it makes the atmosphere of the cafe calm and not chaotic.  The people at Nakoa also don't care about visitors, so I think Nakoa is really good for me time.  My favorite menu here is the matcha latte üíö.  Apart from the matcha latte, the drinks here are also delicious.  The price is also standard, which is under 25,000.  Apart from selling drinks, here they also sell some delicious food, moreover, the donuts are really delicious and cheap üòÉ.  For those of you who like to do assignments alone, you can really try this Nakoa cafe.

Waiting for the new menu for filling my tummy.

This is a special place for co-working which makes it also a great coffee shop. Italian espresso machine Simonelli makes nice coffees and you feel like being in a sort of modern museum. Really outstanding design....well done!

Actually its gonna be a late review cause i've been here for like a month ago. Ok next, so from my opinion is Sudut Coffee is just like others coffee shop startup like a plain concrete chair, small rock in the floor, you know what it is. But it is not a bad thing nor a good things. For the coffee its the same thing but here they serve their signature jamaican something i kind a forget, and i belive its mixed with some rum, but correct me if im wrong. The last things is the cookies which is good, i like it. Overall its okay for me.

Good place and cozy, the baverages taste good but nothing special, the price is standard

Coffee - conversations; or just online gaming with friends cannot be separated.  Sudut Coffee is one of the meeting points for students, workers, and colleagues who want to spend time together, or just doing task.  Sudut Coffee serves you with selected menu at affordable prices.  Wifi are available. An interesting offer is Morning Coffee-time, starts at 08.00 - 11.00 pm just for IDR 10.000,

good for doing stuff like homework/assignments, coffee time or spend some time with friends or loved ones. they need to separate between non smoking area and smoking area. because some of my friends are allergic with smoke"

This place also has free WiFi. Suitable for study and work, or if you just want to eat alone in cozy atmosphere. Gotta recommended this place.

Its located on a remote location, but okay

To be honest i didn't know (or probably never know) if i didn't accidently passed this cafe on my way back home. This cafe is pretty decent for  some remote area/place, it has some cozzy sensation thatvyou usually find on high end cafe on Jakarta or its surrounding. Overall this place have all you need for a stereotype cafe.

The only minus that i'm aware of is the location and place. The first, as i already mentioned it's located on a remote area so it will be hard to find for ordinary people. The second one, although just because someplace located on a remote area doesn't mean the place is definitely small and doesn't have enough parking lot, but on this occasion its is. It will be very difficult if you planned to go into this cafe with a car, because there is no dedicated parking lot for car and even if you planned to go with motorcycle, make sure you go with an single motorcycle if you want park on this cafe.

But after all, this place is overally good if you put aside the location an vehicle problem and just i said before, this place have all you need for a stereotype cafe.

A nice hidden place for a cup of coffee and a cozy atmosphere. Great wifi, great ambience, pretty good coffee but a lack access for parking especially if you ride a car. It opens from 10 AM in the morning."

I came here on the weekend and it is too crowded... Every table is placed too close from one another, I'm wondering if they correctly follow the pandemic protocol for cafe/restaurant (?) Especially the indoor dine-in area... isn't that too crowded? They should lessen the tables

The pizza and the burger tastes nice. Staffs were kind of friendly. The location is quite nice as well although it's very small. The problem is that it took way too long for the food to come out.

Also, when I ordered a cheese cake, the cashier said it was available, so I paid for it, but after a while she said it was sold out. Finally I ordered another cake and the cashier said the change would be given to me later but she didn't give it to me until I finally asked for it myself as I was planning to leave.

Nice place and coffee like home

The nuances of Europe, especially the Netherlands, are immediately felt as soon as you enter a cafe called Huize Jon Coffe. This cafe, which is located on Jl Majapahit, Malang City, carries a different theme compared to other cafes. The combination of Javanese and European nuances, especially the Netherlands, is very strong. From the outside, the modern feel of the building greets every visitor who enters the cafe. Meanwhile, when entering the inside of the cafe, a number of Javanese antique objects are immediately visible. A pair of statues of people dressed in traditional Javanese clothes immediately become an icon on the inside. On the inside of the cafe space, there is also a large Dutch language inscription ""Hartelijk Welkom on Malang. Huize Djon Geschickt Voor Het Maken Van Mooie Uitstapjes Gezzelige Sfeer Voor Iedere Gast"". The writing has the real meaning of Welcome to Malang. Several ancient European and Javanese ornaments, ranging from classic wall clocks made in Germany that are more than 75 years old, televisions, old radios, various leather puppets, classic photographs, to ancient carvings to decorate the sides of the cafe.
The Dutch nuance is also increasingly felt with the inscription in Dutch on the north side of the room, namely 'Uitsmijter Toast'. Uitsmijter itself is the name of a typical Dutch sandwich, while toast means toast.
For the menu offered at Huize Jon, there are various processed coffees such as Original Wine Robusta Coffe, Van Den Berg Wine Robusta Coffe, French Press, Americano, and several other processed coffees. However, for the superior menu at this place, visitors need to try the Dutch special Huize Jon coffe, which is Dutch coffee slightly adjusted to be suitable for consumption by the people of Malang. For menus other than coffee, there are several other choices, such as milkshakes, tea, chocolate, or even ginger. Apart from drinks, this place also provides a food menu, such as french fries, indomie, spring rolls, sandwiches, and several other menu choices written in Dutch, such as Gebakken aardappelen, Vleeskroketjes met mustard, Pannekoek, and various other choices.

Coffee shop that has old skool vibes. serves a variety of coffee and non-coffee drinks and other snacks at affordable prices.

Clean place, pin point map according to location, and there is lodging too.

Huize Jon Wine Coffee is the one you have to try!!
The ""Koffie Met Slagroem"" is also delicious but in my opinion too sweet.

From the outside it looks like an ordinary small cafe, but it turns out to be a very proper restaurant. The interior is super nice and well laid out, clean and tidy, the green tones are really pretty.

The service is very good, you don't have to wait too long for the food & drinks to come out. The ambiance is really nice and makes you feel at home for long. The music played is mostly jazz, perfect for casual conversation.

For food and drinks tend to be pricey. It looks okay, but the taste is really ordinary for that price. The hazelnut milkshake has lots of ice cubes, then the cream itself is half a glass. As far as I know, a milkshake should have milk and ice cream blended together, not hazelnut milk, add ice cubes and then add whipped cream to half a cup. The straws use paper straws, it's good to care for the environment but it makes it hard to drink the cream.

If the latte is okay, served with cookies and sugar separately. It feels great.

Cozy Hangout Place at Sukun

KADO Cafe offers a warm ambience, as well as friendly service. The place is quite spacious and there are also indoor and outdoor areas. Wifi is fast and there are plugs available, perfect for hanging out or working on assignments. I came here when it was just 2 months old. The menu offered is quite diverse, but not too much. It took quite a long time for the food to arrive, around 35 minutes, even though we were the only family dining in. Standard price 20k-50k. For the taste of the food it's not bad, Woku Chicken can be more absorbed in the seasoning, Cordon Bleu can have more portions. Sambal matah tastes fresh. Club Sandwich is on point. Overall there is still a lot that can be improved in terms of taste for KADO Eatery. Always success!

We looking forward to try the almond croissant but unfortunately it already sold out. So we try strawberry danish and meat pie, which pretty decent but still not what we expect from the lot of good reviews written. Personally, prefer the pastry to be more flaky and the filling both sweet or savour more balanced. Place is indeed pretty picturesque if you like to take a photo but not that much place for dine in. I recommend to come in the morning if you want to try all their selection and want to dine in.

My fave pastry place! They have various options of pastry, super tasty with affordable price. The place is cozy and instagramable, it‚Äôs a nice place for hangout in the afternoon or after office time. Unfortunately the coffee isn‚Äôt so good. And sometimes most of the bestseller items are sold out, but they usually restock it again at noon. If you want to try their various or bestseller items i suggest to come around 9-11am. But i still love this place, everything beside the coffee is nice, the pastries, the place, the staff even the parking man is friendly n has a good manner!

Reallyyy super delicious. The croissant is not too expensive. The original croissant priced for 16k only. But beware of the queue because it can be an hour long of wait or more. Place is cute too with the red themed decoration."

One of my best finding in Malang. Suitable for your focus time, nice location, good coffee and barista.

Decent place for working or anything related, they also provide best banana cake in Malang.

Mmmm is one of my favorite coffee shop in Malang. Definitely, they offer you specialty coffee with high quality coffee beans. I usually try their cappuccino with guest beans and also the single origin (both imported or local beans). The ambience is cozy to chill. One of my fav place to chill and work.

Recommended by my friend who said by his/her friend that this cafe serve the best coffee in town

I'm trying manual brew and use import beans from Andrew roastwork

Cant comment anything to this brewer, its 100% solid perfect taste!

and the cookie its very good and cheap, only 10k

Top notch coffee.

The taste of their food especially the fried rice is excellent, very tasty and lot of beef. The drink is also good. The snacks i bought, french fries, is also good on the sauce. Tha price is fair with the taste and quality. The place overall is also good and well built.

There are plenty of seat, outdoor, indoor, either on first or second floor. Lot of facility is available, toilet, musholla, valet parking for car, etc. The staff is also friendly and kind, and their service is made me satisfied. There's also live music on weekdays night if I'm not mistaken. They also sell bread here, so there's a bakery or patisserie in here.

went here for brunch and it was perfect. The place was great, every single spot is absolutely instagram worthy. Various menu from snacks, desserts and drinks and they're ALL so pretty. Most of the customers come with their friends or family. Or you can just go by yourself, doing some online task from laptop while enjoying some of their snacks

It's a little bit crowded in the weekend, but still can enjoy the good atmosphere. You can enjoy a life music here. For me, I don't really like the atmosphere if want to spend a long day :("

Nothing impressed me beside the view of railroads and train passing by. Place are quite a mess and crowded. Coffee's no good at all (compared to those average coffee shops nearby, with same price). Only tried the snacks, and I really lost for words to describe (in a bad way). Not to mention it took nearly 45 minutes to get my order ready. The highlight is, I saw rat running around. Yep, definitely will never coming back.

coffee shop with a view of the train tracks. in my opinion the price is relatively expensive when compared to the taste served.

The taste was okay. But i dont think it's worth the price, cause the portion was small.
They have indoor and outdoor setting. But the indoor was to dark and gloomy. The only good thing was the outdoor (cause you can see the train), but you will absolutely can't use it if it were raining outside.
They played the music out loud to the point of annoying. I spend time to work there, and have a meeting. But they didn't even bother to decrease the volume.
And don't forget the music wasn't suite the cafe vibes.
And also lots of mosquito, if you stay there past 5pm.

Hope the cafe improve its quality, vibes and service.

Nice place for alone or family.
The right place for bring the kid to see train. Lovely vibes.

We found this place by coincidence on a Saturday about 8pm and we found it pretty comfy,  they have an extended good menu and beer. About 100 meters from the Malang Train station. Friendly servers; they speak English and the menu is in English (not that correct English but understandable). We also have some snacks and they were delicious. Prices aren't as expensive as a fancy hotel nearby, but not as cheap as local prices either, resonable prices. I would recommend this place if you stop by Malang for a night or two and are looking for a place where to eat and have some drinks."

my first impression was: the menu is really variative, with affordable price range. the croissant is also really good, crispy yet buttery. definitely must try. i really like the iced coffee latte. i also ordered caesar salad, which surprisingly came in big portion. definitely will come back to try other menu!

I remembered that this bakery was succesfully made a good impression to me especially for their ciabatta bread, but i think recently their quality is not as good as before. Its still enjoyable but i have to say that they could be better..
If you have time, go dine in or takeaway is cheaper than order via grab/gojek since they will upcharge price up to 20%.

The coffee is ok. There is no place to eat/drink on the spot. There is one on the side with a roof, but when I went there during the day it was really dark. The chairs in front of the shop were also compacted, maybe because of covid.

At that time the breads were no longer in the display area, so all that was left was the drinks. The delicious milk coffee with rum (forgot the name). Coldbrew Robusta is pretty good too.

What's worse is that the shopkeeper doesn't wear a mask..... even when making and serving drinks. So it's a bit ilfeel. Even though I'm not afraid of Covid, that's not the case either. There still has to be a health protocol. For shop owners please tighten again.

The place is in the center of city, I recommend you to go there in the night because you can see the light along the kayutangan road. The food is tasty and the service is very good. You should try the rooftop floor.

Really nice place and affordable food!! I‚Äôve been here a view times and i always had a decent time. The place is also very instagramable, it had a really nice design. 10/10 recommended‚ú®

Great & comfy place, for romantic dinner or hangin out with your pals. The vallet parking service is not quite friendly though, shows how differently they treat the high class cars and standard class cars. Pls improve your service equality and quality. Overall food was grear, drinks were ok, and the desserts were yummy.

Unfortunately I had the bad experience with the meal here.
I was here for late lunch and the weather was amazing, I decided to dine in upstairs with air breeze in Malang.
I've ordered Dahayu Tea and the taste was refreshing, its taste sour and sweet smell, just like berries does.

Hospitality was amazing. I enjoyed the quick order proses with the staff and I did not mind to go downstaird to pick up my order and went back again upstairs.

But the meal, I was so sad I had to feel disappointed with this food, the asparagus chicken.
Chicken was served in a hotplate and I hardly wait to try with sauce.

Chicken was hot.
But the sauce was cold as fff, same with the mini croquet and veggies.

I do not know what was going on that day, but all part of meals should served hot. But not for the sauce, even when I mixed the cold sauce and hot chicken, its meal temperature lowering to room tempie.

Not good.

Yep, definitely will never coming back.

coffee shop with a view of the train tracks. in my opinion the price is relatively expensive when compared to the taste served.

The taste was okay. But i dont think it's worth the price, cause the portion was small.
They have indoor and outdoor setting. But the indoor was to dark and gloomy. The only good thing was the outdoor (cause you can see the train), but you will absolutely can't use it if it were raining outside.
They played the music out loud to the point of annoying. I spend time to work there, and have a meeting. But they didn't even bother to decrease the volume.
And don't forget the music wasn't suite the cafe vibes.
And also lots of mosquito, if you stay there past 5pm.

Hope the cafe improve its quality, vibes and service.

The right place for bring the kid to see train. Lovely vibes.

We found this place by coincidence on a Saturday about 8pm and we found it pretty comfy,  they have an extended good menu and beer. About 100 meters from the Malang Train station. Friendly servers; they speak English and the menu is in English (not that correct English but understandable). We also have some snacks and they were delicious. Prices aren't as expensive as a fancy hotel nearby, but not as cheap as local prices either, resonable prices.

First of all, I love the taste of the nasi goreng pete they serve. I was surprised to know that the price was reasonable, considering on where it is located.

Unfortunately, I was dissapointed about the amount of pete they serve. There were only 5 slices? It was more like a garnish üòí
The service was fast. The place was okay. However, they need to provide more space for the smoking area.

I spent Rp 33000,- for the nasi goreng and hot tea. I hope they improve the quality of the dish they serve.

Cozy place, food taste so so, service so so. With the taste and price, I prefer street food. It was okay, but I will not comeback üôÇ

Nice coffee shop in araya, famous residential area in malang, the place is large and homey, equipped with comfortable sofas indoor and table chairs outdoor..
Citra bakery stall is available, coffee, snacks, and some indonesian food like rawon, mie kacang etc are available, however the overall taste is just standard..
Surprisingly the price is quite affordable.."

There's smoking and non-smoking area. The I dont taste all of the menu, but the I love the rice box blackpepper. I service of the place is good about the person, but they are not ready with few things such as tissue and the refund (uang kembalian) doesnt prepare well.

Love the atmosphere and the food.
It is worth the price. And it is quite cheap compare to other cafes in Malang.

However, it took soooo much time for the food to be ready. Maybe because it's always crowded with people.
Also, they played the music so loud. So you might reconsider to visit this place if you like a quiet place. But they also provide a special room for study or work, so you might use that.

Don't ride a car to visit this place, it's hard to find the parking lot.

Semusim Cafe is on St. MT. Haryono Malang, exactly across from Brawijaya University. This cafe has two floors which are always busy every day with visitors who are mostly students. This cafe sells cheap food and drinks so it is suitable for student pockets, prices start from 7,000 to 20,000. This cafe is open every day, open from 10.00 to 00.00. This cafe has a Scandinavian decoration concept so it is very interesting to visit. and apart from that this cafe also has air-conditioned first floor facilities, there are sockets on each table without worrying about running out of battery, as well as a prayer room for Muslim visitors. Meanwhile, the second floor is a smoking zone as well as a place to carry out tasks. This floor cafe is non-AC, it won't feel hot because of the lots of ventilation and the use of fans to provide extra comfort to visitors.

Price is so affordable. Taste is okay not so extraordinary, only got the problem with too much sweetness for the drink. Place is well and nice, so comfy and having a decent interior.

Strategically located accross the uni. Very affordable price, cute interior, nice ambience (although mostly very crowded), food taste exceeds my expectations."

It's cozy, quiet, not many smokers (well, at least when I was there). Good choice to have a quality time but, also a perfect place to work on your paper. The air circulation definitely amazed me. The food is quite good, most of it is good but almost no option for spicy good. The drinks feels so right, so good. Also, this place is spacious, there are indoor and outdoor space and not so crowded, just perfect! Price range from 17k to 30k something. The staff is friendly too, much love‚ú®Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Plus point for their nice, quiet and cozy ambience. But not a fan for what they serve. Coffee taste not so good, and their mashed potato is bland with no creamy taste at all. Or maybe I just pick the wrong dish? Improve your dishes and drink, and maybe I'll consider another visit.

Will definitely be my favourite coffee shop in Malang. The coffee is superb! Try pour over V60 Gayo wine beans. Sooo light and clear. And surprisingly, it's not really expensive for such a fragrant and tasty coffee. The place? So much greeny and peaceful. It's got a concept a vintage house. A house during Dutch colonization. I feel like in my grandma's house in the village.

The second time we comeback here‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è the pancakes was seduced me.
Price really ok for the good pancakes.. 15k for the single basic pancakeüòç
And caramel macchiato üòçüòçüòç pasta was ok. Ricebowl also still worth it..
Cozy place to chill maybe work little bit chit chat.. maybe little bit chill music make this place more cozyü§ó
but one thing little bit bothering me that I had to sit next to active smokers people who smoke all the time even I told him that is bother us.
Cause is writen no where in this room! So disrespecful and 0 tolerant.

Good coffee- reasonable price - good ambiance-good service- serve a free water.

Cozy place to spend time with partner or friends, the price it's standard and the taste also, there is parking area you should pay 2k/motocycle, there is smoking area, they sell coffe with plastic cup, I hope in the future this shop does not provide plastic cup and plastic staws also, go green !

The cashier was somehow hostile toward customers; when you work providing this type of services, you're supposed to be 'approachable', easy to talk to. The man who was serving the coffee and tea, the barista, or I assume was the owner of the place, was a lot friendlier. Go here if you're looking for a 'hidden gem' cafe that has the soothing and greeny vibes because the music wasn't too loud and it has lots of plants, plus the location is quite distant from the main street.

Oh wow, what a hidden gem I found here in Malang.
I love their concept, it felt like you're visiting your frineds house and hanging out at their garden. The place is not crowded, the vibes are chill and the drinks are great. They provide a great coffee beans here, and the capucino were great! my fave!,
I tried some of their snacks as well, and Inlike the avocados one, surprisingly good, but I think they could only served several sets per day.

would def come back again (hopefully regulary)

‚ÄúHidden Gem‚Äù in Malang that Must-Visit for the one who loves Speciality Coffee and for those who loves to explore n appreciate good vibesüòÅ. An amazing experience I had with the owner, very warm-welcoming, friendly n humble person. Very good vibes place. Amazing coffee n lots of selections of coffee, tea, snacks. $-$$$. Amazing place to do meetings, WFA, and to unwind.

This experience, ordered the Arabica Bajawa Espresso + Cafe Latte
Also the Leuchtfeuer Coffee Costa Rica for the manual brew

Thank you for the experience and best wishes for Roewang Tamoe Coffee

Not exactly sure what is the hype, I know this place from social media and when I was there, sure the coffee is quite good. There are some bread and pastries which seems good.

The one that got my bad side was, since this place is in residential area there were some snack vendors going around the block. When I tried to buy snack from vendor (the coffee shop didnt have this snack and I was still buying their coffee and snacks) they straight up forbid me. I understand there is a ""no food from outside"" rule, but there were no other costomer inside and I always clean up before myself.

Homey coffee shop with retro vibes interior design. Served great coffee. Wanna comeback for sure."

coffee ok lah, but the panini is not worth the price,,

Place little bit small but of course still have good coffee

1. The place is rather small than the other two (maxx and sbux) they only have five tables indoor area and two or three tables outside.
2. Ordered a choco drink (forget the name) and a chicken panini. Taste wise, pretty good and simple, nothing breakthrough tho. Might ordered something else later.
3. Don't come here when you are hungry. Took almost fifteen minutes (or more) to serve. Personally didn't bothered, the order might be overloaded anyway.
4. The staff was nice and easy on eyes üòÖ

Kouja is instagramable place for you to hang out and gathering with your friends. Has a photobooth. This place is also able to be a venue of the event.

Great new cafe with different concept

The location is a row of cafes.
The parking is wide.

It just seems unkempt. The location is in front of Sarijan Cafe. Very spacious inside, perfect for assignments and meetings.

If you say it's instagramable, in my opinion 7/10 depending on the motto, you have to have flat angels.

Service... it seems the staff is minimal, so it's not optimal, when I went there in the afternoon before maghrib. That's it, there's no food. Drinking is also limited. And the taste of the coffee is not worth the price. I feel like Nescafe ü§≠At that time I was a student and I was there. Why did he say this drink tastes like pop iceüòÖ

There are toilets and mushollah, just like that, I want to go to the toilet and the mushollah is really not clean, heaps of piles of gt. The toilets are clean, the mushollah needs to be cleaned especially for prayer.

If cleanliness is not maintained and the quality of the food is not improved, you are worried that you will go out of business, especially since there are so many cafes around that are much cleaner and cheaper and taste good.

Price is considered normal for a cafe, give them a try if you are looking for a place to relax and gather photo content.

If you are a coffee addict, I suggest that you order a hand brew, about 4 beans profile for you to choose from. My feedback is that they consider upgrading their espresso machine and grinder for better shots and milk frothing. Not a fair comment maybe cause I have high expectations over espresso base coffee.

It looks crowded but actually it's because other shoppers are selfish hanging out for hours just buying a glass of tea.
Twice to Warmindo, I didn't get chairs and tables to eat Indomie.
Average menu. Student budgets. More or less the same as other warmindo.

Ordered noodles 2. 1 sucked 1 regular fried indomie, only came 1 hour later. Until the ice pop, the ice cubes melt üòÇ The noodles are okay. It's ripe. But the fried noodles are really soft, the noodles cook too long. Next time, just give it a timer, if it can't be cooked, it's sure to be mushy.

H. Yusuf Jagung Bakar - a hangout place that is different from the others. This place has a mainstay menu of roasted corn and shaved corn.
The taste of the food provided varies, I personally like salted shaved corn. The place is quite spacious, can be used for hanging out dozens of people at once.
The downside of this place is that it doesn't provide wifi and sockets at every table.

Lots of hot snack menus. The roasted corn is okay. The ginger wedang lacks the taste of ginger, too much sugar. Spacious place, but not suitable for children

Good taste, no parking area

The mint tea is delicious and very fresh. Ask for less sugar but still sweet. The place is small, you can't hang out, there are only long benches for sitting. The place is rather small but crowded because it is in the campus and boarding house area. The parking lot is a bit cramped on the road if it's just for motorbikes it's enough, for cars it's rather difficult

Drink shops with quite affordable prices, there are various kinds of variants ranging from fruit variant teas, fresh milk, and yakult mixes are also available.

Order the passion fruit tea, orange juice and Thai tea variants, request less sugar but still sweet. Maybe you can reduce the sugar content a bit.

For the passion fruit tea, it would be better if it had the original passion fruit pulp, so it would be fresher.

In terms of service, including fast, yes, the packaging is also okay

I like Glek's mint tea, the mint is quite strong...
But unfortunately it's bad... I ordered less sugar here... but it's still really sweet... it's like drinking sugar water... even though I asked for less sugar...

Banana snack is a must try really. It feels really good. Can be ordered online too. If you want to buy it directly, you can too. Road access is quite easy.

Crispy breaded bananas on the outside, sweet and soft bananas on the inside. Attractive packaging, the box is equipped with a fork and uses safety adhesive, neat. The contemporary topping tastes great. Macha green tea tastes really good plus chunks of delicious almonds. Chocomaltine tastes crunchy and chocolate melts on the tongue. Oreo topping is also delicious. All the kids like this. Order using the Gofood application and can pay using Gopay, there are discounts at this restaurant.

Not have experienced

Unpleasant incident buying LPG for the first and last time here, never again. I asked the shop keeper to deliver and install the LPG, the person said yes and I paid 18 thousand. Then I said that the stove is on the 2nd floor. Ok. Then it turned out that he couldn't put the new one on and the tube was dripping, and it was really rusty and it was so bad that I was scared. The reason is that the diameter of the lpg holes is not the same, I have to replace the regulator even though it's new. The one who is at home is his wife. I was even told to be honest right when I was in the shop if I was told to put it on and on the 2nd floor. Eh, sir, where if people can do something, there's not much of an excuse, right? Eh, when he finally gave up, he didn't install it, instead he wanted to go home. I didn't say just bring the new LPG because I was afraid it would leak, I had good intentions to just change the shipping fee because it was really close to the boarding house. And my LPG cylinder was still new and actually the regulator still showed that there was content, it just glowed red. The guy chuckled, didn't want to return the money, instead he said yes, I already have enough money, 18,000 I can't get anything. I said, please, if I lose, I won't get anything, instead the hose and stove are removed. Yes, it's better not to be there, it's still on. The point is I'm disappointed, if I say I'm told to be sincere, that's fine, but the way of selling like that isn't a blessing, sir. Not recommended at all. Such shame to ever purchase from this shop

Pretty close to the mosque

This place aren't serving up anything too different, but they're sticking to what they know‚Äîgreat roasted coffee.
It's a nice tiny place with a huge deal of details. Feel the unique vibe and enjoy the afternoon catching up with friends.

Another Malang's hidden gem! Recommend this place for coffee lovers. Not a big place, and the location is quite far from Malang downtown, but the design is really interesting, kinda industrial, but has a homey vibe. And since it has an open bar setting, you can have coffee talk with the barista, Mas Pandu, also the owner of this coffee shop. Lataroma means house yard, which is literally built in the owner's house yard. Yang jadi ciri khas di sini adalah semuanya serba manual, mulai dari mesin roastingnya, espresso, sampai untuk steam susunya. Untuk yang bukan pecinta kopi, bisa coba menu matcha latte atau caramel latte yang cukup manis. Range harga mulai dari 15 ribu sampai 35 ribuan. Overall, tempat ini yang menyenangkan untuk dikunjungi.

Small place but the owner setting very well. Sourdough Sandwich and dessert all good.

They served manual brew meticulously. Time, temperature, water, even their bar was setted and completing each other with the coffee. Nice ambience and nuance too. Thank you!"

It's a very enjoyable place with delicious drinks and recommendations from me, Turbo Coffee and Comfort. In addition, there is a co-working space equipped with supporting facilities (LED TV, blackboard, bean bag, and wifi)

Nice place, new concept, still quiet, close to UIN main campus, with bean bags.. this is truly heaven coffee and space!
I give 4 stars because the quality of the coffee is still lacking, the coffee variants are also still small, there needs to be additional coffee variants and also the taste itself

Only tried the snacks, and I really lost for words to describe (in a bad way). Not to mention it took nearly 45 minutes to get my order ready. The highlight is, I saw rat running around. Yep, definitely will never coming back.

coffee shop with a view of the train tracks. in my opinion the price is relatively expensive when compared to the taste served.

The taste was okay. But i dont think it's worth the price, cause the portion was small.
They have indoor and outdoor setting. But the indoor was to dark and gloomy. The only good thing was the outdoor (cause you can see the train), but you will absolutely can't use it if it were raining outside.
They played the music out loud to the point of annoying. I spend time to work there, and have a meeting. But they didn't even bother to decrease the volume.
And don't forget the music wasn't suite the cafe vibes.
And also lots of mosquito, if you stay there past 5pm.

Hope the cafe improve its quality, vibes and service.

Nice place for alone or family.
The right place for bring the kid to see train. Lovely vibes.

We found this place by coincidence on a Saturday about 8pm and we found it pretty comfy,  they have an extended good menu and beer. About 100 meters from the Malang Train station. Friendly servers; they speak English and the menu is in English (not that correct English but understandable). We also have some snacks and they were delicious.

Clean on the dining areas, toilet needs improvement. I sorta expected too much of the weather, hoped it to be rather chilly. On the contrary it's just humid and 27dg. Oh beware of mosquitos!

Great for outdoor quick photoshoot.
There was an outdoor picnic set up for groups, interesting.

I only go there once, and i think i will think twice to go there again. I appreciate their concept of making a cafe with a nice scenery in the evening. They have some chairs and tables in the yard. So you can have chit chat either with your friends or your boyfriend/girlfriend. I like one of the menu, banana nugget. However, the serious point is that i think the menu are overprice for some ppl like me. Also, they dont offer various menu to be selected.

Cant take a proper picture yet rest assured it was a nice place to hang out. However, i hope that there are more food options in the menu.

Great place to hangout with friends and family. A lil bit cold at night because it's semi outdoor place, don't forget to bring your jacket or warm suit. Super cozy atmosphere!

Good place to chill and spend time with companies or by yourself.
All drinks and snacks are highly recomended with pocket friendly price.
Nice hospitality and cool peacefull ambience.
Also provided clean restrooms and spacious musholla, a huge plus point for this cafe.
This the type of cafe where you could feel a strong homey feeling, totally recomended."

There are several choices of types of coffee (average iced). The system is take away because there are no seats.

Tried it when there was a promo on Gofood. Spiced chicken rice. The chicken is crispy but delicious. Get chest. Juicy gt. Gentle. The flour is crunchy not hard. Fried when an order comes in. The restaurant was active in chat because the choice of chicken available was different from my notes. The sambal is really good. The rice is fluffier. Thank You. So I want to stop by there.

Ps. Thinwall, spoon and cup are mine.

eh, it's delicious.. after trying it because when there was a grab promo too.
The toast from before it was opened already smelled so good.
it's sparkling palm sugar ulalaaa

eh, the spiced chicken is really good, the seasoning is just right. the smell is very good. what's more.. the meat is soft and tender.. the crunchy dough is similar to the smell of buttermilk chicken duh, it's delicious. try it.

Tried both desserts and  slightly heavy meal, for me it's worth the price. Will try others in the future. Staffs were super nice too.

one of my fav cafe, all the drinks are delicious, dessert and meal are good in taste, the price so cheap but the taste are good,comfortable for chilling with friend,they have a lot varians menu, the place are clean with good service,the parking area is not wide.

Overall, it was a pleasant experience dining out here. We orderes several dishes: Chicken Nanban, Meatball something and Matcha Kitkat Cake. For the drinks, we had Cappucino Caramel Crumble and Buttercookies Tea.
The foods taste great. I could tolerate the crunchiness of the chicken katsu, while the sauce completes it really well. It's savory and creamy.
The Meatball also kinda startled us because they use some kinda strawberry sauce. It's new for us. Surprisingly, its sourness and sweetness don't overpower the savory taste of the meatball and mashed potato.
For the dessert, I picked the matcha cake. I could really taste the matcha flavor out of it while its not being too sweet. I love it.
I'd probably revisit the place to try another cake on the selections.

Katamichi is 1 of the best and comfiest cafe in town. It's decoration is awesome and cute. Food and baverage here is delicious, you gonna find them cute and lovely as well. Recommend this place for hang out with your friend or do your work. Their tea and cake is super recommended. You also gonna find some cute stuff there!
Everything will be perfect if the place have Japanese song on their Playlist, so the ambience is truly Japanese.

Unfortunately I had the bad experience with the meal here.
I was here for late lunch and the weather was amazing, I decided to dine in upstairs with air breeze in Malang.
I've ordered Dahayu Tea and the taste was refreshing, its taste sour and sweet smell, just like berries does.

Hospitality was amazing. I enjoyed the quick order proses with the staff and I did not mind to go downstaird to pick up my order and went back again upstairs.

But the meal, I was so sad I had to feel disappointed with this food, the asparagus chicken.
Chicken was served in a hotplate and I hardly wait to try with sauce.

Chicken was hot.
But the sauce was cold as fff, same with the mini croquet and veggies.

I do not know what was going on that day, but all part of meals should served hot. But not for the sauce, even when I mixed the cold sauce and hot chicken, its meal temperature lowering to room tempie.

Place is excellent, both the interior and the exterior, the rooftop might be the best. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Quite recommended, best visit the place at night.

The place is in the center of city, I recommend you to go there in the night because you can see the light along the kayutangan road. The food is tasty and the service is very good. You should try the rooftop floor.

Really nice place and affordable food!! I‚Äôve been here a view times and i always had a decent time. The place is also very instagramable, it had a really nice design. 10/10 recommended‚ú®

Great & comfy place, for romantic dinner or hangin out with your pals. The vallet parking service is not quite friendly though, shows how differently they treat the high class cars and standard class cars. Pls improve your service equality and quality. Overall food was grear, drinks were ok, and the desserts were yummy.

Unfortunately I had the bad experience with the meal here.
I was here for late lunch and the weather was amazing, I decided to dine in upstairs with air breeze in Malang.
I've ordered Dahayu Tea and the taste was refreshing, its taste sour and sweet smell, just like berries does.

Hospitality was amazing. I enjoyed the quick order proses with the staff and I did not mind to go downstaird to pick up my order and went back again upstairs.

But the meal, I was so sad I had to feel disappointed with this food, the asparagus chicken.
Chicken was served in a hotplate and I hardly wait to try with sauce.

Chicken was hot.
But the sauce was cold as fff, same with the mini croquet and veggies.

I do not know what was going on that day, but all part of meals should served hot. But not for the sauce, even when I mixed the cold sauce and hot chicken, its meal temperature lowering to room tempie.

Not good.
I really not planning to coming back here."

disclaimer on, this based on personal experience
aside from the remotely and hard to access area this coffee shop offer a more personal touch for your ordered brew...
the beans used for manual brew is get from local area, occasionally they'll have a guest beans from far away...
the machine based coffee is somewhat lack in my personal opinion...
if you want a random surprise just say so to the barista, he's rather friendly for a new customer...
greatly recommended for those who seeks new companion and idle chat with someone new while take a sip from your glass...

Just arrived, already greeted by the cashier who doesn't have a smile. How come, miss, the cashier is that bitchy? I'm sorry, but I'm here to pay and I don't owe anything, but it feels really bad because of one person (namely, the cashier). Please, ladies and gentlemen, train the cashiers first, so that at least the customers are happy. Thank you

The place is comfortable, there is a bathroom, a prayer room even though it's makeshift, the place isn't too wide but it's closed, so it's safe if it rains. Wifi too. The minus might be a bit hot during the day, maybe fans can be added in the future"

They have tropical-industrial decoration, really like cafes in Canggu, and the coconut tree there really fits with the vibe. They sell mainly non-alcoholic drinks, but they provide cold beers as well. Kinda pricey if it's compared with any other cafe in Malang, but still reasonable. Definitely a must visit if you have an occasion in Malang.

Good vibes cafe. The only constraint is hard to fine car parking here. So my suggestion if you wanted to come here, just bring motorcycle or public transportation.

Sara takes advantage from the building original colonial architecture to present warm atmosphere for customers. With calm yellow light and some colorful wall and garden decoration, customers are welcomed to have some humble-but-classy dining.
They serve familiar snacks, such fried banana and fries, decent and well cooked. Some meals like fried rices are also available for those hungry tummy to fill before a long chit chat over coffee. The coffee prices are reasonable and brewed perfectly balance. What I do like from their coffee is that they present it separated from the sugar, so I never miss the original taste.
Sara is a family and small group friendly place to spend quality time at. And still, this place is suitable for customers of all ages.

a cake shop located in a quiet & cool area.  you can find many European & Indonesian snack here,.. dine in with a cup of coffee in the morning and you will ready to face your day. cheers!

The kombucha is on point! the chicken is good but the sauce is just average.

We already go back and forth asking them and they always say that its because the rice is not ready. and we are not the only table waiting in such a loooong time like that.

It is very sad tho, they could learn something about supply chain management and communication between team to prevent this kind of issue.

The service is good, the cashier and one of the waiters are friendly and answer all our questions despite the crankyness we had (hungry due to waiting for an hour).

I like the chicken & kombuca here!

A small local restaurant/cafe with great service, food, drink and overall experience! They have a rooftop and oke bgt waktu senja2 dateng kesini!
Definitely a go-to place for cafe when you are in malang Huge portion of roasted chicken (which is tasty) & side dishes are delicious as well.

A lil bit shocked that malang has a place to drink kombucha in a market. Their kombucha is nice but i think if only they can make it more sweet. Price is not too pricey. Better come in the afternoon

Probably the most impressive thing this cafe can offer is the ambience of the surrounding. Very vibrant as many random people are wandering. The coffee itself is good, but not great. Price wise is affordable, pretty much similar to other similar cafe types. Come here with 3 to 4 friends and enjoy coffee time.

the place is comfortable, there is also a prayer room, so there is no need to bother looking for another place to pray.

I love this place. A really cheap coffee with killer taste! Taste and smell it, but the most important thing was having a conversation with random people was great. Unfortunately, if you are an anti-smoke person, don't visit this place, too many smoke of cigarettes but it is good for social interraction!

Design is unique

The place is very comfortable clean and also seems simple not a fancy cafe. The coffee menu is very diverse and is also served from various coffee beans that we can choose for ourselves. For the price, it is still standard in the class of cafe cafes that sell contemporary coffee.

But yesterday when I ordered manual brew v60, the taste of the coffee was still lacking in my opinion, either because the coffee beans were not fresh, or something else that I didn't know.

Hopefully the owner of the teacher and also the barista will always improve their brewing skills, so that the quality and taste of the coffee will be better.

great coffee, they have in-house roastery, and you could buy roasted coffee beans there, and ask them to grind it if you didn't have grinder at home. the only minus for me, is the mushola looks so dirty, and hidden in the 2nd floor, and didn't really well kept & clean

but I do highly recommend the smoking / non-smoking room, for a casual or business meeting. I usually visit Labore after 19.00, their night vibe is also lovely.

As soon as I walked in, I was struck by the charming Chinese-themed decor, complete with an impressive collection of antiquities and old photographs of Indonesian landmarks.

The ambiance of the cafe was simply amazing with the old grandma style house and interiors, full of wooden style furniture that added to the overall charm of the place. The windows provided a stunning view of the nearby stream, accompanied by the soothing sound of flowing water. It was the most unique cafe I have ever been to, and I was immediately taken aback by the tranquility and serenity of the surroundings.

The menu was equally impressive, offering a range of delicious food and beverages. I tried their pisang bakar and it was one of the best I've ever had. The rate of the menu is very cheap as well.

All in all, I would highly recommend this cafe to anyone looking for a unique and memorable experience. The ambiance, the food, and the service are all outstanding, making it an ideal place to relax and unwind. I look forward to visiting again soon!

The decoration is superb, it's like an oriental museum. Perfect for someone who loves antique or unique building and someone who loves taking photo. The water sound came from the river and the fish pond make a relaxing ambiance. But sadly, there is no smoking room in this cafe so the visitor can smoking everywhere and it's make me uncomfortable. The taste of main menu is so so and a little bit salty. The tea is good tho. The price is really affordable

This place has so many beautiful spot, including the theme, building style which have unique design both the building and the interior (antique things), the garden, the fish pool and it‚Äôs surroundings that so homey, was really good for instagram and heaven for people who love taking picture. Foods and beverages was average enough. My two cents of this place would be the connection both menus and the ambiece, because the menus not-that-oriental antique, contradicts enough with the ambience.

Good vibes cafe with such a good books collection like Yuval Noah Harari's books. Not that pricey also. The menu's price ranged from around Rp. 10.000 - Rp. 30.000

Oriental style ~look like museum~ coffee shop with lots of antique stuffs inside. Menu is vary, especially light meal with very affordable price. Best table to sit is next to window where you can see a small river and bamboo trees. Collections bit dusty that are supposed to be well maintained to keep the existence."

A decent place to cob for coffee and hang out looking for ideas to build a nation.
Good luck and more and more cafes

comfortable place, friendly menu, ppkm effect so it's rather quiet

Dear Management, sitting with coffee.
Permission to provide criticism and input.
My first time coming here, intending to do an assignment.
The place and menu are highly recommended.
However, please maximize the service by front/cashier, because when I went there in front of the cashier's desk, I only saw it, (ignored) and wasn't asked what to order, and when I ordered a drink on the menu it said 10k and the cashier said 12k ( 12k receipt, its different then)

When I ask why the price is different? The cashier just replied ""I don't know, Miss, in the application, this is it"" with an unfriendly tone to answer it.
Well, I just paid then, even though it felt uncomfortable with his attitude.

Incidentally at that time the cashier who served the mas who was a bit ""fat"" (I'm sorry I mentioned)
Hopefully the service will be even better for the sake of mutual comfortüôè

Good place, especially in the afternoon the view is rice fields‚Äù that's cool"

Tasty food and drinks. Their taste are unique and gorgeous. Cozy place for spending time, working, or meeting. Also, there's a room seems like meeting room for 6/ 8 people or more maybe. Price is not cheap, start from around 30 thousand rupiahs, yet worth to try"

Great coffee shop, deserve more recognition. The Baristas are super friendly and informing, and last but not least, the prices do make sense.

Good place for enjoying aeropress coffee

a good place and good food. the price starts from Rp 10.000 (if I'm not mistaken). it's like a hidden place to relax and grab a coffee and read a book.

It's cozy, quiet, not many smokers (well, at least when I was there). Good choice to have a quality time but, also a perfect place to work on your paper. The air circulation definitely amazed me. The food is quite good, most of it is good but almost no option for spicy good. The drinks feels so right, so good. Also, this place is spacious, there are indoor and outdoor space and not so crowded, just perfect! Price range from 17k to 30k something. The staff is friendly too, much love‚ú®Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Plus point for their nice, quiet and cozy ambience. But not a fan for what they serve. Coffee taste not so good, and their mashed potato is bland with no creamy taste at all. Or maybe I just pick the wrong dish? Improve your dishes and drink, and maybe I'll consider another visit.

Will definitely be my favourite coffee shop in Malang. The coffee is superb! Try pour over V60 Gayo wine beans. Sooo light and clear. And surprisingly, it's not really expensive for such a fragrant and tasty coffee. The place? So much greeny and peaceful. It's got a concept a vintage house. A house during Dutch colonization. I feel like in my grandma's house in the village.

The second time we comeback here‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è the pancakes was seduced me.
Price really ok for the good pancakes.. 15k for the single basic pancakeüòç
And caramel macchiato üòçüòçüòç pasta was ok. Ricebowl also still worth it..
Cozy place to chill maybe work little bit chit chat.. maybe little bit chill music make this place more cozyü§ó

Give Kopituju a visit and you will see how this place stands out among the rest of the buildings. Going inside, the ambiance is humble but welcoming. Coffee was simply satisfying, one of the best in town. In general, this cafe feels like an oasis in the hustle and bustle of Malang, where you can escape for a caffeine fix.

Best coffee in Malang (in my opinion), and their burnt basque cheese cake, is the best I have ever tried.

Even though the price of the black brewed coffee is affordable (Rp. 4,000), the taste is very authentic. The coffee tastes thick, according to my taste.

The chicken fillet is delicious. Can add additional cheese sauce. Several levels of spiciness are available. There are various snack choices such as chicken, mushrooms, sausages, dumplings, and so on. Prices are cheap too. Due to the pandemic, it looks like it's only for take away. There are free sauces such as seaweed sauce, bbq, mayo and balado. Good and fast service.

Good drink
Good Price

From the outside it looks like an ordinary small cafe, but it turns out to be a very proper restaurant. The interior is super nice and well laid out, clean and tidy, the green tones are really pretty.

The service is very good, you don't have to wait too long for the food & drinks to come out. The ambiance is really nice and makes you feel at home for long. The music played is mostly jazz, perfect for casual conversation.

For food and drinks tend to be pricey. It looks okay, but the taste is really ordinary for that price. The hazelnut milkshake has lots of ice cubes, then the cream itself is half a glass. As far as I know, a milkshake should have milk and ice cream blended together, not hazelnut milk, add ice cubes and then add whipped cream to half a cup. The straws use paper straws, it's good to care for the environment but it makes it hard to drink the cream.

If the latte is okay, served with cookies and sugar separately. It feels great.

Cozy Hangout Place at Sukun

KADO Cafe offers a warm ambience, as well as friendly service. The place is quite spacious and there are also indoor and outdoor areas. Wifi is fast and there are plugs available, perfect for hanging out or working on assignments. I came here when it was just 2 months old. The menu offered is quite diverse, but not too much. It took quite a long time for the food to arrive, around 35 minutes, even though we were the only family dining in. Standard price 20k-50k. For the taste of the food it's not bad, Woku Chicken can be more absorbed in the seasoning, Cordon Bleu can have more portions. Sambal matah tastes fresh. Club Sandwich is on point. Overall there is still a lot that can be improved in terms of taste for KADO Eatery. Always success!

Food and drinks are good and quite a variety. Affordable prices

Yes, tonight, at 21:20, I just arrived, according to the serlok, the location of the goggle map sent by my business partner, namely the director of the Mushroom Construction Group, whose house is only 20 meters from this restaurant. The location is on the right of the road if we go from the direction of Dieng Plaza to the south after meeting the red light at the intersection, then turn right for about 20 meters, cus. Arrived at the eastern sticky rice restaurant. Immediately, my colleagues were told to order. Lightning fast, tell the cashier, order the original sticky rice (ketan dkw) the price on the written prize list board. Keep drinking hot tea. My colleague drank hot ginger, special sticky rice powder. And for parking if r4 is limited, yes. If R 2, accommodate, yes 15 motorcycles. The total bill was about 20 thousand. Sbw, 0812+4212014

Nice Place, Good Vibe

The place is comfortable at night, in my opinion, it's not too cold, and what I like for coffee is the sofa seat hehe, the price is average in Malang, but the presentation and portions are quite satisfying

I recommend for you
Oh yeah, the place is open 24 hours, note it !!!

For the location on the side of the road, so even though the cafe is quiet it still feels crowded

during the day a bit hot ,, but the night is very interesting place ,,
drink prices start from 8k,,
There are also snacks and heavy meals, from 10k

The coffee served at the coffee shop ""PORTAL COFFEE MALANG"" is coffee from the Malang region. There are Arabica coffees such as Arjuno, Kawi, Parangtedjo, and Selorejo Dau. Then there is Robusta coffee which is a mainstay, namely SRIDONORETNO (DAMPIT) coffee.

Previously, Portal Coffee Malang was one location with The Roots Barbershop Malang. But now the two have moved to separate locations near the old place. The most favorite here is of course the processed coffee. In the afternoon, visitors can also see the coffee roasting process for themselves. There are various types of robusta and arabica coffee beans on offer. Starting from Malang local products and several other areas. Good preparations include palm sugar milk coffee, brewed coffee, V60, afogato, and others. For those who don't like coffee, there are choices of traditional drinks such as wedang uwuh, nasi kencur and turmeric tamarind. Quality and taste to be reckoned with."

+ nice surroundings
+ various menu and beverages
+ price start from 10k
+ enough parking lot for bike, not for cars
+ friendly barista
- if you come on 9pm or above, you can‚Äôt order food
- too empty in some area.

I came here at night around 8pm, and its nice ambience. I recommend to come after 4pm.

Perfect place for chilling, location is strategic, reasonable price, Im not a big fans of strong coffee and their coffee taste so smooth, great match for those who cant stand thick and strong coffee

the baristas are friendly, the menu is affordable, and for the place is not too spacious but comfy enough.

Such a great place to hangout with some friends (but not too much). Roomy and spacious. FnB is just great and taste very good. One beverage to try is Rum with milk and biscuit.

Only one thing, this place closed at 9.30 pm. So, better not to come here late at night.

good coffee, enjoy this place!"

For those who don't know and want to know
What's an ice pot?
The ice pot is marni colored ice cream placed in a small pot which also has various colors and is decorated with toppings according to your wishes.
It can be chocolate granules, fruit, jelly, colorful candies and chocolate milk which makes the ice cream just unique
This ice cream doesn't taste much different from the ice cream we usually eat
It's just that it's made in a very unique and funny way, sometimes it's a shame to eat itüòÇ
This ice was very popular at the time, it's just normal now
In Malang, it's in the food court, Malang Town Square, or commonly called MATOS
But the 1st floor is near the stairs
More or less priced at 10-15 thousand per portion, I'm very satisfied with choosing my favorite topping. 1 topping 1 top layer yes
If it's more than that, you usually pay more

Not bad. Unfortunately, when I bought it, Ms. forgot to give the worms. Maybe because the first buyer.

The ambience is good, decoration is perf, the service also nice, plus point they have a good song play there. However their food just normal one nothing special. And as per expected the place getting crowded when the lunch time nearby. All in all its great place to hang with your friends then have a great photos :)

The staffs were friendly, quick. The place, of course is the main attraction here. But the drinks were nothing special that prices around 25-29k. the mushroom pizza was fine tho. french fries is just like the regular french fries in some other restos, which fast food branches still taste better.

I came here on the weekend and it is too crowded... Every table is placed too close from one another, I'm wondering if they correctly follow the pandemic protocol for cafe/restaurant (?) Especially the indoor dine-in area... isn't that too crowded? They should lessen the tables

The food is good
The staffs, especially the security is sooooo friendly and helpful ‚ô°

The pizza and the burger tastes nice. Staffs were kind of friendly. The location is quite nice as well although it's very small. The problem is that it took way too long for the food to come out. That's the thing that gives an illusion of this place being crowded at all times. Not because of they have a lot of customers, but because of slow service. Had the food taste bad, I would've rate it 1/5.

Adorable and cozy cafe in heart of Malang not so crowded. Decorated well in Bali style we love the ambiance so much. Drink was great although food not meet my expectations. Staffs were very friendly and attentive."

Very friendly service. Food hygiene is also maintained, as evidenced by the spoons wrapped in plastic for each food ordered. There is free WiFi too.

The food is delicious and definitely halal. The price is also in accordance with the taste offered. There's even a promo so it's cheaper. Super like the drink :)

For a comfortable atmosphere, you can choose to sit in a chair (1st floor) or cross-legged (2nd floor). Only when I went to the 1st floor, the table was a bit wobbly, so it wasn't comfortable. Maybe it can be fixed...

The first time I came here, the impression was that the design was unique, good. The first husband chose Balinese coffee and Toraja but it was empty. Finally choose Lampung coffee. But, the taste is not bad. The service is really top. All friendly service. Get free french fries. thank you

They have tropical-industrial decoration, really like cafes in Canggu, and the coconut tree there really fits with the vibe. They sell mainly non-alcoholic drinks, but they provide cold beers as well. Kinda pricey if it's compared with any other cafe in Malang, but still reasonable. Definitely a must visit if you have an occasion in Malang.

Good vibes cafe. The only constraint is hard to fine car parking here. So my suggestion if you wanted to come here, just bring motorcycle or public transportation.

Put it in your go to cafe repertoir

It was a good place to kill the time with your mates. The place is quite easy to reach and also comfortable to chill or doing some work. The menu is interesting because you'll find different variant of coffee that rarely served at another coffee shop in malang like salted caramel coffee and also caramel macchiato which as far I know I can only find it at starbucks coffee. The minus is the lighting at night that just not the same the indoor and outdoor area, thats just look not so good. And also the concept of the indoor area was so so, I mean not really special. But over all the caramel macchiato was good :')

I tried their latte and it was real good. It was served in a cute cup, without a teaspoon (as other cafes would do). But I enjoyed it much. Also, their 'cireng bumbu rujak' is refreshing!

Good place with homey vibe and of course the Cappuccino is great for me with such price.

Nice little coffee shops, ample outdoor space, decent power outlets, good selection of beverage. The baristas were kind and polite (just make sure to ask them if there is any requests about your order, they'll be happy to help you or you just want to chit chat with them). The only downside is, there isn't any decent parking space (you must park your vehicle beside the road, and the road just too damn narrow). 3/5 (-2 points for the availability of the parking space.

You can find many snacks available here such as baked bread, french fries, nugget... and don't missed the main dishes, i recommend nasi uduk and lontong sayur which available from the opening hour until 4 p.m. The atmosphere is quite cozy with a direct view to the rice fields, but it's occasionally so crowded especially during the weekend.This place has fast wifi connection, and a sink to wash your hands.

This is my first time come to malang for my study, and yaahh my lil friend recomend me to visit these sweet lil cafe. The coffee is really tasty, i order Lupa Lelah Signature and yeah this is my favorite here. Good prices and nice service. Nice view.

Cozy place, good coffee and snacks... A little bit too long for the serve... But it's okay

I stayed one night and spend the whole time around NK Cafe. The food was superb, the staff are friendly, the air was cool, great place to spend time with family. There is jacuzzi in the villa, the rooms are fully equipped with amenities. NK also offers variety of activities such as coffee roasting education, gardening and veggie picking which is also safe to directly to be eaten.
One thing I have to mention is safety-ness of the area during rain. Overall, I had great experience here, well done NK!

I ordered their Pot Ayam Kungpao and the amount of chicken dices surprised me. It was a lot. And it tastes great actually. Yet, the star was the butter coffee. It was my first time drinking such a unique and calming coffee. They added some butter into the coffee and when they're blended, it gave some sweet creamy kinda taste. I love it!

Beware of the queue as it gets so long on weekend. Pricewise is cheap as the portion is big. The main dish served at 09.00 but it opens at 07.00 so if you come before 09.00 you have to wait for the dish to be served. Really love the rice pot because i think it only sold here. The kungpao is dominant with sweet taste but really great. I recommend you all to order the milo tarik cause its super great üëçüèª

nice ambicence, like singaporean kopitiam in 80's

Good coffee and teh tarik

Must try the claypot rice, savory and tasty
and kaya toast, the sweetness is just right.

Beware of the crowds every weekend morning.

I don‚Äôt usually give 3 stars rating but i hope this served as a feedback to improve. Was honestly liking the whole ambience of old chinatown neighborhood because it just felt so nice & very down to earth. What gives me not so pleasant is it took too long to serve when there‚Äôs no queue. Ordered butter coffee & somehow it‚Äôs fine just not really my liking. Also ordered kungpao chicken which tastes okay (which for me i think you could do better to make it taste more like kungpao chicken), and the last is mie kwa which I don‚Äôt really fond of‚Ä¶. It just tastes wrong. The noodles are okay, it‚Äôs ordinary but the soup is just ??? I‚Äôm losing the concept of the taste because it‚Äôs herb-y, with the wrong kind of bitter taste in it. I hope you could improve the taste somehow and take this feedback because the place has a good potential !

The ambience is like ""tempo doeloe""
It is really crowded in the weekend, you should come on the weekdays if you don't like to queue
Their kopi butter was good. I like the unique taste. Coffee with butter? Why not
Their food just okay for me

You can try to relax with friends/girlfriends. But it's a shame to go there because I just don't know what the menu and the place are. But it's a pretty cool place. And for the menu, because I happened to be there after eating, I just wanted to ice it so I didn't try the coffee. The snacks are pretty good too. It may be a confused choice to have coffee and spend time around there because there are many choices. Oh yes, the minus here is that there are a lot of buskers at night, so you have to be prepared for a lot of change.

Nice. On the edge of the rice fields, unfortunately the fields are not visible because it is night. The coffee is bali and there is gayo. The price is according to the pocket, it doesn't break. Various snacks and there are noodles. Saturday night and Sunday night it's crowded.

A decent place to cob for coffee and hang out looking for ideas to build a nation.

Sauce for the chicken chop is good but oily. Pricing is standard. Good packaging for take away and delivery. Food can be ordered by food delivery app

Ambience and the staffs were okay but after waiting for like 40 mins (which is  long if you ask me) the foods and drinks that came together were all served cold. Not the best option considering the pricing is pretty standard for similar cafes yet my drink tasted nothing like what i ordered. Came here to work on my laptop but the wifi is down and even if they'd work, staffs said the wifi got a time limit for 3 hours. Like??
This was like my 4th time here and before this my experiences were ok if not the best but this would be my last. Won't be coming back again.

Took a long time for the food to come out, no table service so we have to wait for the food downstairs. Ordered some cupped drinks and one of it wasn't sealed properly so it spilled everywhere when carried.
Someone else also took my order without the cashier noticed. Maybe they should have put numbers/names in an order so it's easy to call out the order and no one will mistakenly take other people's order.
The place itself is nice but it's crowded, and sometimes there's a selfish customer that takes table for 4 by themselves.
The menu wasn't updated, I came here for Tacos as they have it on the menu on Google Maps but when I came here, they don't have it. For Malang standard, it's quite overpriced.

wait for approximately 30 minutes and the server ended up saying the food that i ordered was out of stock. coffee milk??? should've named it MILK coffee, barely tasted any coffee.

The food is delicious pol!!! The roasted rice is the best, the service is fast, you can also get discounts and order via gojek. The toast is delicious, which unexpectedly gets free iced tea and also a new menu. Must try!!! Guaranteed you won't regret it!!! The portion of the roasted rice is upgraded to a rather large size. Order the second time and still get free iced tea! Very delicious.

Nice clean comfortable cafe, not far from entering the cafes with live music suitable for all groups from young people to the elderly

-Tea Bar Leaves-

Bored with hanging out at the coffee shop, so you can shift to the tea shop. The tea here is not just any tea. The taste is very unique, it is made directly so it is guaranteed to taste fresh and distinctive. You can really request if you want sweet or sour. The price is also very affordable, from 15-25 depending on the taste variant. The stock is also sometimes empty, yes, because the seller is deliberately possible so that the original taste doesn't disappear and disappoints.

For me, who is enjoying tea for the first time, it's delicious, isn't it? Friendly and polite service. Parking is good for motorbikes. There are indoor and outdoor. Very close to the highway. Comfortable seating both inside and out. Toilets are also clean. It's cool to just sit and enjoy tea alone or with friends and family.

Thirst savior drink with various variants of processed tea and fruit drinks.

In my opinion, the most recommended are Jasmine Hibiscus and their Mogu-Mogu Tea. So refreshing!

Apart from drinks, there is now a food menu and side dishes such as chicken katsu, corn dogs and home made brownies.

Often pass by but this is the first time stopping by and finally regretting why I didn't stop by yesterday
The drink is really delicious, fresh, can be an alternative if you are bored with coffee drinks, there are also many variants
The place is not too big but quite comfortable, clean too. The service is friendly & polite, recommended"

The waitress is fast in responding the food order and serving the plate. However, during the raining season i found out the smoke of grill activity quite annoying inside the main room.

The place is hidden in a small road and unexpected üòä I found it by chance but it was actually a nice surprise. I like the setting especially the veranda outside. A free setting makes the place look bigger and relaxing atmosphere is obvious here.
The drinks are good and the sushi is ok.
Lots of parking place for motorcycles but the cars have  to park on the side road next to it. Worth a try üòäüòä

Affordable good food with big portions, better sit outside under the shade because the indoor building is too hot even if all aircons were turned on. The service from the waiter/waitress was good, but not for the cashier. The cashier lady was unfriendly and not very welcoming towards me & my friends, she handled our order lazily like she didn't want to be there.

Love the ambiance. It's located in a quiet neighbourhood. Vast parking area. Very bright, the place will put you in a good mood once your glance at it. Really love the outdoor area. Best time to come here I think is around 3-5p.m. Coupled with Malang fresh air. Definitely a place for a fun gathering with friends. Food was alright. We ordered School Dosirak and Jjajangmyeon, with Itaewon (ReVe drink) and Hongdae (milk w/ salted caramel). Itaewon drink could be better. Hongdae was tasty. The staffs were very friendly and helpful.

Love the atmosphere here. For those who want to feel the Korean vibe and who like K-Pop, it's really suitable here. The parking lot is quite wide and next to Sejenak Coffee.
The interior design looks simple from the outside, as soon as you enter, you immediately feel the Korean vibes because of the Korean decorations and music being played. Aesthetic in every corner.
There are quite a lot of indoor and outdoor places. In the indoor area, there is a really good photobox. In the outdoor area there is a pojangmacha selling street food.
The menu options vary, from snacks to heavy meals. There is a grill package menu, ramyeon and other menus such as mandu, kimbab and many more. For drinks, there are quite a few choices. There is also a showcase filled with bottled and canned drinks. Prices range is 23 thousand - 55 thousand rupiahs. Suitable for lunch or dinner. Or hanging out, snacking, and enjoying the vibes is also okay. If you're expecting food in k-drama, you'll find it here.

Overall it's a good place and good eats."

The coffee itself wasn‚Äôt bad. Nothing to complain about the comfort inside either. I am not giving 5 due to its parking space. That was too small and dangerous to parking in that area. And I don‚Äôt know that was legal to build a building near a train rail.

Still better for me, since they have excellent staff and their coffee is superb!

After exploring many coffee shops, I found one coffee shop which I think is really worth it for students like us to visit üòÄ.  Nakoa cafe Bondowoso is one of my favorite hangout cafes, it seems I have visited this cafe countless times.  The reason why Nakoa is my favorite cafe is that most of the people who come here are students doing their assignments, so it makes the atmosphere of the cafe calm and not chaotic.  The people at Nakoa also don't care about visitors, so I think Nakoa is really good for me time.  My favorite menu here is the matcha latte üíö.  Apart from the matcha latte, the drinks here are also delicious.  The price is also standard, which is under 25,000.  Apart from selling drinks, here they also sell some delicious food, moreover, the donuts are really delicious and cheap üòÉ.  For those of you who like to do assignments alone, you can really try this Nakoa cafe.

The place so comfy for works both indoor and outdoor, the coffee is great too. WiFi so fast, the staff so friendly, i have a good experience at Nakoa Cafe, just need some improvement to make the toilet clean. Overall is good, i'll come again to Nakoa Cafe. Waiting for the new menu for filling my tummy.

This is a special place for co-working which makes it also a great coffee shop. Italian espresso machine Simonelli makes nice coffees and you feel like being in a sort of modern museum. Really outstanding design....well done!

I think the doughnut is a normal doughnut. It has no speciality, except the price, 9k ü§≠

My kinda go-to coffeeshop. Not so crowded, affordable price for a quite good coffee, free parking. Not so much on the menu to offered, but I think it's just simple. Would love to have another visit to try their pastries.
Update : I tried their pastries. But I think I'd skip it next time.

A little coffe shop at Malang city. Worth to visit. Self roast coffee beans, roasted by its owner. There are Arabica and Robusta variety, which came from Pantan Terong, Lintong, Kenya, Wamena, also Kintamani, and others..

They have La Mian and also Rice Bowl for big menu. Pastry, Toast Bread, Friench Fries, and other elses for the snacks.

Friendly price, good service and wide parking space.

Delicious Lamian in town!! I didnt need to add soy sauce or chili sauce because the flavor is very umami. I ordered Mie Kuah Pangsit and Tahu Walik. The Tahu Walik is filled with real meatüíñ!. Unfortunately, I gave 4 stars because the service was very slow and they didn't clean the unused cutlery in my table until my food came (this isn't self service restaurant). So I ate my food while there was still unused cutlery in my table, I had to ask the waiter 2 times to take the unused cutlery.  Hope they'd improve the service quality better in the near future üòÅ

Ordered from Gofood the price doesn't reflect the taste and the food quality because i got a very delicious pasta and burritos for a very reasonable price. i went to an Italian restaurant in malang before they have an Italian chef so the price is kinda little bit more expensive but i could compare the taste tbh so definitely worthy although i hope they can improve the burritos a little bit because there's too much sauce and i prefer them to be fresh with less or no sauce."

- they have limited space, and some areas are too hot. Better visit in the morning or afternoon
- limited parking for car

I love with the interior, chill and calm.. My fav tea is the one with lychee and rose flowers. Unfortunately the menu variations is not much..but if you wanna try Korean food, Seoul Scent just right next to this cafe..

Went there when they have ‚ÄúSarapan Gratis‚Äù promo and everything was soooo good üòç

Hidden gem that are not too busy, with carefully crafted menus.

Nice place, aesthetic in all parts indoor & outdoor, for drink I like sigurih the most. When I went there, it was cloudy and then after a while it started to rain. While the indoor area is not that wide, so there are some visitors who take shelter outside, I suggest it would be even better if the indoor area was expanded.

Also, when I ordered a cheese cake, the cashier said it was available, so I paid for it, but after a while she said it was sold out. Finally I ordered another cake and the cashier said the change would be given to me later but she didn't give it to me until I finally asked for it myself as I was planning to leave.

So please improve the service again, and hopefully it will get even better on my next visit, but overall this is a great place üòÖüåø‚òï

For a moment to be alone in this place, it's comfortable place, it's nice food and drinks and peacefull"

The choco & cheese toast is very sweet because the chocolate paste is very much. Be careful with your sensitive teeth üòÅ

It is a cozy place to chill, outdoor seating, power outlet you can get some work done here. But it is somewhat hot in the afternoon.

The food is nice and the drink is pretty good. Be mindful that traffic noise may be a little loud.

a spacious place to grab some snack and afternoon tea. cakes are various, includes traditional ones. taste are worth the price. should be live music show if it weren't for this cov19 situation. not much option for main course, but then again, it is a cake store!

This place is an alternative for you who bored with modern cafe/coffeeshop. Cake Shop Sara has an old-school classic vibes.

MORELOCALGROWING

I feel SYAHDU ATMOSPHERE when I enjoy poor coarse coffee at the shop which is located in this small alley.

Because the location is inaccessible to vehicles, it's better to park on the side of the main road or in the main square.

Arriving at the location, we can choose whether we want to sit on the available benches & tables, or take a stool (plastic chair) and find our own seat along the aisle.

Even though the price of the black brewed coffee is affordable (Rp. 4,000), the taste is very authentic. The coffee tastes thick, according to my taste.

If you don't like regular brewed coffee, Kauman also provides a variety of coffee flavors that are more modern and suitable for today's youth."

Super cozy place. One of the best waffle in town with a lot of delicious toppings. Recommended!

Cool place, good grub. Waffles were tasty and filling, smoothie bowls were yoghurty instead of pure ice which I prefer (smaller than usual but for the price you can't complain, you can literally buy 2 if needs be). Super helpful and friendly guys running it, they helped sort/buy our train tickets and even did scrambled eggs on a waffle for us which they seemed very confused about haha. If you're in Malang, head here.

This place is awesome. Located in front of a house (actually a women center) this place serves you waffle with various and healthy topping. Also, there are smoothies with a lot of healthy nut and seeds. But unfortunately, oftenly when i visit this place is closed, because they have to support outdoor events. But, you have to try it.

Delicious and sweet! Such a great place for hanging out with friends and enjoy good waffles. They also sell healthy food and salty food. The order sometimes can take much time to get but it worth to wait. The price also affordable for student. Recommended!"

Simple. The price is enough to make you full without breaking your wallet, with the right taste. In my opinion, the chili sauce is not enough spicy kick for me who likes jarring spicy. But this can actually be made for people who want to eat it but not too spicy, because my friend wants to eat this, which unfortunately has a lot of the spiciness, he can't stand it and eats it so it's not enjoyable for him and people who can't handle spicy. So, for those who don't feel spicy enough, there's a whole chili just crushed in the mouth, it's as light as a firecracker for me. üòÇ

The place is quite clean.

Place review :
So this outlet has a unique and cool model in my opinion, it's more like a Korean theme ""alay like that, the seats use private material and the original is nice to look at but this material if it gets hit by rain it will rot and break
This outlet is staffed by mothers and children, the mother may be in charge of taking care of food such as donuts, waffles etc. while the cute and virgin part of the barista-style drinks, it's a shame the two of them don't wear cool uniforms like outlets"" the other one instead wears short shorts. wkwkwk üòÇ...(tomorrow just wear lingerie so it's badaasss), but they still feel clumsy in the halter eh not flexible when making the order process, the plus point is that the mother-child duo are friendly üôè, one more this outlet is more for take away as a table There are no chairs, there are only chairs for waiting for the order, only 2 birds

Food review: the drinks are manstab abiz semanstab the video is cut tari vs ariel noah... oops üôä, the process of making waffles and donuts takes quite a long time even though I saw them using modern equipment (I can imagine if you get a lot of orders it will definitely be more complicated and the process will be more delayed takes a long time...

That's all... warm greetings from Garangan Elegant

The coffee taste is strong, the quality is also the best. There are donuts & cirengnya also delicious. Keep up the quality & qualityüëåüèª

The coffee is delicious, the side dishes are also delicious, the prices are also reasonable, it's not surprising that talented artists have several times ordered drinks (especially coffee) from Daycinno, the best anyway

It has smoking and non-smoking area. It‚Äôs neat and cozy, that kind of place you could spend your time for chit-chatting or doing your work/thesis. It provides most of western foods and some of asian‚Äôs. It also serve snacks, pastries and bakeries for you to munch around. The staffs are good and helpful, the toilet is clean, and the prayer‚Äôs room is neat and clean (it provides a very fragrant prayer‚Äôs mat and prayer‚Äôs set).

My favorite beverage from this cafe is Milkshake. I didn't find a matcha milkshake for this cafe. When I was a college student, this cafe was always crowded but cozy and quiet.

I recommended Work From Cafe in this place. This cafe must maintain the furniture and interior, but for the taste always be lovely, for waitpersons must smile and be friendly to the customer. BTW, this cafe must pay attention to the plating.

Nice and cozy place and they have smoking (outdoor) and non-smoking (indoor) areas separated. Free Wi-fi and power outlets are available. I think the number of the tables is a little bit small, not surprising because the place is not big. Nevertheless, with the right and nice interiors and light, it feels spacious enough. They apply the new normal protocol so we found that some tables are not in used. I think the chair could be imrpoved, though. I certainly like it if it more comfortable, especially if I want to do my work in the place.
We tried the apple pie, which is part of the pastries displayed at the front counter. It was scrumptious, with the perfect crispy, flaky dough and the right sweetness and sourness of the apple filling. The caesar salad comes as a combination of lettuces, generous amount of grilled chicken, and a slice of garlic bread but with different dressing than the usual yellow caesar dressing I used to know. It uses some kind of mayonnaise combined with certain herbs and spices I think? Kinda tasted the parsley in the dressing somehow. It tasted nice and fresh.
The salted spicy tofu is good, although I prefer mine to be a little bit more salty. It comes with a separate sauce made of sweet soy sauce and chili flakes. The vegetables cream soup tasted good but the texture is somehow quite thick, reminds me of a very thick porridge instead of soup. They're certainly generous with the amount of the vegetables, however.
The chocolate+milk is quite nice, while the iced lemon tea is proved to be a hit for me (definitely want to order it again!). We're lucky enough to get a free ice cream waffle with minimum 100K rupiahs purchase (choose between chocolate, strawberry, or banana one). The strawberry waffle comes with strawberry ice cream, strawberry slices, strawberry jam, and whipped cream that I found very rare used in the waffle sold here in the city. The offer will last until the end of August, by the way.

This place is cozy and classy. You can see yellowish color across the room, so it makes you hungry as soon as you enter the room and almost don't wanna leave it :)) but, if you want to sit comfortably, you may come at afternoon or evening here since this place is too crowded at night. Don't worry about the food and beverages quality, 5 stars are for all menu. Standing applause!

The outdoor area is so comfy with pool and coffee table with chair, while the indoor area is bright, clean and cozy. The toilet is big and clean.

I really like this place, definitely would come back and be my choice to spend my time to leisure or working. This restaurant concept is Scandinavian themed, from the design, language, choice of food on the menu, and anything in it.

The taste of their food especially the fried rice is excellent, very tasty and lot of beef. The drink is also good. The snacks i bought, french fries, is also good on the sauce. Tha price is fair with the taste and quality. The place overall is also good and well built.

There are plenty of seat, outdoor, indoor, either on first or second floor. Lot of facility is available, toilet, musholla, valet parking for car, etc. The staff is also friendly and kind, and their service is made me satisfied. There's also live music on weekdays night if I'm not mistaken. They also sell bread here, so there's a bakery or patisserie in here.

went here for brunch and it was perfect. The place was great, every single spot is absolutely instagram worthy. Various menu from snacks, desserts and drinks and they're ALL so pretty. Most of the customers come with their friends or family. Or you can just go by yourself, doing some online task from laptop while enjoying some of their snacks

It's a little bit crowded in the weekend, but still can enjoy the good atmosphere. You can enjoy a life music here. For me, I don't really like the atmosphere if want to spend a long day :("

Fruitbar ! I'm so happy to meet you,
I ordered for the first time via go-food.
I ordered a fruit salad.
It's great! The contents of the fruit also include a lot, even though the price is also cheap.
The mayonnaise and cheese are just right.
I haven't tried other menus yet, but next time I will order again here.
Highly recommended!

The best one is the durian soup fruit soup. The star who talked has not been able to take a photo

In the photo below, the fruit salad is no less fresh and the mayonnaise is original üëçüëç

the product is great. The fruit soup is really full of fruit. I've also tried durian soup, very good. The thick gravy really tastes like durian. The most important price is roadside prices. In cafes, it's probably 20k and above.

great. My favorite durian fruit soup. Good portion and taste. If in other places, with this portion the price is much more expensive. It's on gofood too

In my opinion, the most delicious and thick juice is in the fruitbar. unfortunately not many people know. only put in go food."

The drink variants are coffee mix, yakult mix, ice cream mix, milk variant. The toast has sweet variants such as chocolate and cheese, then savory variants such as egg chicken or beef. The sauce topping is very delicious, I recommend the chicken cheese toast with a creamy mushroom sauce If you don't like sweet toast.

The choco & cheese toast is very sweet because the chocolate paste is very much. Be careful with your sensitive teeth üòÅ

The coffee itself wasn‚Äôt bad. Nothing to complain about the comfort inside either. I am not giving 5 due to its parking space. That was too small and dangerous to parking in that area. And I don‚Äôt know that was legal to build a building near a train rail.

Nice place and coffee like home

The nuances of Europe, especially the Netherlands, are immediately felt as soon as you enter a cafe called Huize Jon Coffe. This cafe, which is located on Jl Majapahit, Malang City, carries a different theme compared to other cafes. The combination of Javanese and European nuances, especially the Netherlands, is very strong. From the outside, the modern feel of the building greets every visitor who enters the cafe. Meanwhile, when entering the inside of the cafe, a number of Javanese antique objects are immediately visible. A pair of statues of people dressed in traditional Javanese clothes immediately become an icon on the inside. On the inside of the cafe space, there is also a large Dutch language inscription ""Hartelijk Welkom on Malang. Huize Djon Geschickt Voor Het Maken Van Mooie Uitstapjes Gezzelige Sfeer Voor Iedere Gast"". The writing has the real meaning of Welcome to Malang. Several ancient European and Javanese ornaments, ranging from classic wall clocks made in Germany that are more than 75 years old, televisions, old radios, various leather puppets, classic photographs, to ancient carvings to decorate the sides of the cafe.
The Dutch nuance is also increasingly felt with the inscription in Dutch on the north side of the room, namely 'Uitsmijter Toast'. Uitsmijter itself is the name of a typical Dutch sandwich, while toast means toast.
For the menu offered at Huize Jon, there are various processed coffees such as Original Wine Robusta Coffe, Van Den Berg Wine Robusta Coffe, French Press, Americano, and several other processed coffees. However, for the superior menu at this place, visitors need to try the Dutch special Huize Jon coffe, which is Dutch coffee slightly adjusted to be suitable for consumption by the people of Malang. For menus other than coffee, there are several other choices, such as milkshakes, tea, chocolate, or even ginger. Apart from drinks, this place also provides a food menu, such as french fries, indomie, spring rolls, sandwiches, and several other menu choices written in Dutch, such as Gebakken aardappelen, Vleeskroketjes met mustard, Pannekoek, and various other choices.

Coffee shop that has old skool vibes. serves a variety of coffee and non-coffee drinks and other snacks at affordable prices.

Clean place, pin point map according to location, and there is lodging too.

Huize Jon Wine Coffee is the one you have to try!!
The ""Koffie Met Slagroem"" is also delicious but in my opinion too sweet.

The owner is friendly and likes to greet customers. Thank You

- The chicken tender rice for the sauce is too runny and bland, but the rice and chicken are delicious
- The matcha drink is too sweet and doesn't taste like the matcha, more to the sweet taste of the milk
- For service it was still lacking, at that time my order was not delivered to the table, I thought it was self service, but it turned out that there was a customer behind me whose order was delivered to his table, even though it was quiet at that time and the employee sat in front of the cashier and when he came home too play hp.

For all the delicious drinks, try the delicious peach yakult, the coffee isn't bad either. Affordable prices. But the food... It's barely edible :( the tofu looks like it's about to go stale, it's fried in bland flour. It's really sour, it doesn't taste good, it's really messy.

Hopefully the service can be improved, the cashier is too lazy to serve him, we asked questions about the menu, the answers were lazy. It's a shame even though the place is quite okay.

A new cafe that is quite close to home. Perfect for hanging out with friends. On Friday and Saturday there will be singing on the 2nd floor.

I came here on the weekend and it is too crowded... Every table is placed too close from one another, I'm wondering if they correctly follow the pandemic protocol for cafe/restaurant (?) Especially the indoor dine-in area... isn't that too crowded? They should lessen the tables

The food is good

The pizza and the burger tastes nice. Staffs were kind of friendly. The location is quite nice as well although it's very small. The problem is that it took way too long for the food to come out. That's the thing that gives an illusion of this place being crowded at all times. Not because of they have a lot of customers, but because of slow service.

Apart from serving good coffee according to personal opinion, the hospitality and serenity at this place have become one of the ""escape"" and ""hidden gems"" among shops in Rajekwesi, Wilis, Malang City.

Come here every morning at 7 on Sunday-Tuesday for ""NgoPag"" and have a light discussion about the coffee served

Starting from the Manual Brew menu to the Espresso Based menu, it also has its own experience and enjoyment

With the experience and taste tours gained, Coffeenensis is counted as one of the pocket-friendly Coffee Shops, of course in accordance with Malang City which is filled with students and their walletsüòÑ

Besides being able to enjoy various coffee dishes, here you can also get Roasted Beans from Gunung Kawi which of course have been carefully curated by the Coffeenensis team.

Greetings and Success
Jaya Always for Coffeenensis & their Society!
Graceüôè

It's a comfortable place for morning coffee and hanging out until late at night, the opening hours are also regular, you can check on their ig at @coffeenensis so you know about the opening hours and the various line ups of beans.
People really like to chat and share about whatever they can, so it's also suitable to ask them questions about coffee while looking for new experiences.

I don't know why if I look on Maps it closes at 23:00. But, me and my friends want to try new vibes. Eh, it turns out that at 8 it's already closed + I ordered it just arrived 10 minutes... For the coffee, it doesn't offer anything different from other coffee shops. Be better.."

Honestly I'm not a person who likes to drink coffee for health reasons. But some coffee I can drink ¬Ω is enough for tomboys to want.

I messaged:
Milk tofu 10/10 WENAK POL NEMEN FAVORITO
Fried bananas but I can't take pictures 1000/10 MY FAVORITE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE MAMA'S MOM :"") crispy skin, ripe bananas just right, a portion of 10 rebu pray asdfghjkl
Kupi Khop Susu 8.5/10 My friend who likes coffee said it was really delicious, but back to me, I don't really like coffee. And it's pretty good that I can drink half, my stomach doesn't hurt, it's just auto-literacy all day long. It's really unique because it's behind the wkwkwkw but it doesn't spill

For fun, I asked the barista who happened to be the owner himself ((((((: he said, this coffee is originally from Aceh. So for coffee lovers, you should know how different it is.

I came here at night but wanted to try here in the morning. The problem is that there is bird's nest rolled which my friend said is also good for catching huhu

Ambience is okay, it's quite comfortable because there are chairs that use the famous GT chairs, soft on the buttocks. I think it's important for those who want to be here for a long time to hang out or something.

Regarding the price, it is cheap for the Kopitiam class, let alone Aceh. It seems like this is a new Aceh Kopitiam shop in Malang. Yagasih?

Will come back again. But morning.

Oh yeah, it's not just in the morning, just in the afternoon - evening. Afternoon closed.

+ : large area, large parking area, diverse menu, okay drinks, okay food
- : the service needs to be improved, the food was forgotten for quite a long time, it was only made after being reminded, even though there was already a clear queue in the kitchen.
Almost all the menus were sold out when it arrived around 8pm, maybe I didn't expect it to be this busy

The coffee is unique, enjoyed upside down. No photos, just connoisseurs. I don't usually make content... delicious, cheap, worth it

I like coffee, it's unique

This cafe has spacious, comfortable and air-conditioned meeting rooms. The bathrooms are also clean and there is also a prayer room on the 3rd floor. The food and drinks at this cafe are also very diverse and pocket-friendly. When I visited here, I ordered fried noodles and eggs, and an ice bubblegum latte. The bubblegum latte is just right on the tongue and not too sweet. I think this cafe is highly recommended for you to visit, especially for students who are bored just doing their homework or boarding houses.

Al-fath cafe is located on Jl. South Mertojoyo Block C04/01 Lowokwaru Malang. Aesthetic forging makes visitors feel comfortable. A variety of food and drinks are served.

Not only that, this place is also an environmentally friendly place. So Alfath cafe is perfect for meeting, chatting and studying together or alone.

Last night I and My friend went to Alfath cafe to do the task together. This cafe is open from 8.00 a.m untill 10.00 p.m. This is My first time going there.

After we have arrived  there, the place was very comfortable,  aesthetics of view, and a large parking lot. The vibes is very suitable for study, learning, discussion, and meetings. Not only that, Alfath cafe also has many menus starting from drinks, food, to Snack. The price is quite cheap. The services of waiters and orders are also very pleasant and fast.

There, I ordered one Ice of Americano as a black coffee and My Friend ordered one Ice of Matcha latte and snack. The coffee has a very balanced taste, neither strong nor bitter. The Snack there are Sausage, French Fries, and Tahu. It's so crunchy and tasty.

I and My friend were very happy and enjoyed it. Thanks‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ú®

There was an outdoor picnic set up for groups, interesting.

I only go there once, and i think i will think twice to go there again. I appreciate their concept of making a cafe with a nice scenery in the evening. They have some chairs and tables in the yard. So you can have chit chat either with your friends or your boyfriend/girlfriend. I like one of the menu, banana nugget. However, the serious point is that i think the menu are overprice for some ppl like me. Also, they dont offer various menu to be selected.

Cant take a proper picture yet rest assured it was a nice place to hang out. However, i hope that there are more food options in the menu.
