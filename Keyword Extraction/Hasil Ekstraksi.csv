Cafe Sawah Pujonkidul,ChIJc357HEEp1i0R6hhXCd3R2ts,"Kawasan Cafe Sawah, Desa Wisata, Krajan, Pujon Kidul, Kec. Pujon, Kabupaten Malang, Jawa Timur 65391, Indonesia","tourist_attraction, cafe, amusement_park, park, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment",4.5,17274,1.0,"Cafe Sawah Pujon Kidul is one of the cafes located in the Pujon area This cafe is close to residential areas Here there are various kinds of food and drinks at low prices In addition in this cafe there are also rides for games for children teenagers and adults Beautiful scenery and cool weather make people who visit the cafe enjoy the atmosphere there more The car park here is wide but tourists who use buses must use a motorcycle taxi service to go to the location because the parking lot is quite far from the location Apart from that there tourists can bring souvenirs such as vegetables fruit fresh milk and others because there is a market available for shopping

Great atmosphere this place for city folks who doesnt connect to the nature on everyday life Good place for eating some snacks and talks They have guide to show the place around This cafe managed by locals The access to this is through the locals street so be careful when you go there cause theres kids on the road that play around They have Guest house on this cafe
The only downside here is that they play music from the speaker For people like me who works in the city pak enjoying the silence of nature is better than some bad sound from speaker

it such wonderful and peaceful place for you having holiday with family and friends we can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the farming field and having snacks in the middle of farm we can also buy directly from the farm of vegetables that are harvested 

Overall the cafe sawah itself is ok Nice view Service could be improved for better
Rather difficult to order and take long time to get the food we order Taste is standard Ambience is ok They also have rooftop area There are some spots to take a picture perhaps this is its USP Unique selling proposition

Price is affordable eventhough some visitors say the price is expensive
If you want to go here just for eating you will be disappointed because it is located inside village tourism area so that to enterreach the restaurant you have to pay ticket in the locket 125Kperson and parking 10k for car
Payment  cash in major

disclaimer on this based on personal experience
aside from the remotely and hard to access area this coffee shop offer a more personal touch for your ordered brew
the beans used for manual brew is get from local area occasionally theyll have a guest beans from far away
the machine based coffee is somewhat lack in my personal opinion
if you want a random surprise just say so to the barista hes rather friendly for a new customer
greatly recommended for those who seeks new companion and idle chat with someone new while take a sip from your glass

There is a new cafe owned by UB which is located inside Raden Wijayas gazebo Its a bit hidden but the place is spacious comfortable for hanging out and eye catching The concept is outdoor so the seats are all outdoor

located on the 2nd floor of the tempe spiritual chip shop comfortable place there is parking the room has a terrace inside and there is a meeting room

the price with the portion and taste is appropriate even very satisfying at that price I tried drinking lemon tea and eating spicy basil chicken the chicken is delicious for those who like spicy its just right the basil is just right not so fragrant basil so even if you dont like basil you can still eat this for the plating and packaging is also okay

but because the location is on the 2nd floor its not suitable for older people earlier I slipped on the stairs too because the footing was too small and tight in my opinion

Hands down one of the most comfortable coffeeshops in Malang Even though the location is not too close to the Soehat area it turns out that the trip there is worth it

First you see the building looks like a vintage house but overall it looks neat the combination with the furniture which is dominated by wood fits perfectly It feels cool and homey especially the area isnt too crowded so you can feel calm

Try ordering the Japanese brew and heavy food Make the coffee just right and make it proper following the baristas advice for the choice of beans and it turns out to be exactly according to taste There are many drink menu choices whether you want coffee or noncoffee

For food you can order curry rice this one is special I myself dont often order heavy food at coffeeshops in Malang but here it really is the food is delicious The curry is really good even though its not too thick but the taste itself is delicious Plus there is katsu which is big in size and rice which seems to be in the panfry again so it has a taste The food combination is really delicious guaranteed not to regret it And the portions are huge for the price For now its a favorite curry in Malang you can even find something unique in a coffee shop There are also several kinds of heavy food and all of them are interesting of course I will try the others on my next visit

The service is also very friendly and quite good can also provide an explanation regarding the food and drinks that we will order where a brief description is also given on the menu

The seating area consists of indoor semioutdoor and outdoor I myself sat in the semioutdoor patio area near the bar There are also plugs available so that it is suitable for working while drinking coffee and eating The smoking area is in the outdoor near the parking lot The seats themselves arent that many but considering the proportions to the build theyre just right

Additional facilities such as wifi are also available there are also toilets

Parking for cars is in front of the coffeeshop while motorbikes are in the side area enough to accommodate visitors

Overall its really nice to have coffee in a quite different area a quiet area Suitable for work while enjoying coffee Plus the food is delicious this is really a plus so you dont have to bother moving places to eat Make sure to include the list of coffeeshops that you will visit",0.975,0.0028946911364557,0.6833684073409367,1232,"baristas advice, delicious curry, coffee noncoffee, curry rice, want coffee, coffee plus, coffeeshops malang, coffeeshops visit, comfortable coffeeshops, japanese brew"

A very cute charming cafe The vintage style is special here The table legs are made of old sewing machines and the wooden look makes everything very cozy The owners are a cute little Indonesian family who run the hostel and the cafe themselves Even the coffee beans are produced on their own farm We loved that the owners mingled with the visitors to chat with us Jon and his son are wonderfully humble people who made our stay in Malang unforgettable We will be back again

The nuances of Europe especially the Netherlands are immediately felt as soon as you enter a cafe called Huize Jon Coffe This cafe which is located on Jl Majapahit Malang City carries a different theme compared to other cafes The combination of Javanese and European nuances especially the Netherlands is very strong From the outside the modern feel of the building greets every visitor who enters the cafe Meanwhile when entering the inside of the cafe a number of Javanese antique objects are immediately visible A pair of statues of people dressed in traditional Javanese clothes immediately become an icon on the inside On the inside of the cafe space there is also a large Dutch language inscription Hartelijk Welkom on Malang Huize Djon Geschickt Voor Het Maken Van Mooie Uitstapjes Gezzelige Sfeer Voor Iedere Gast The writing has the real meaning of Welcome to Malang Several ancient European and Javanese ornaments ranging from classic wall clocks made in Germany that are more than 75 years old televisions old radios various leather puppets classic photographs to ancient carvings to decorate the sides of the cafe
The Dutch nuance is also increasingly felt with the inscription in Dutch on the north side of the room namely Uitsmijter Toast Uitsmijter itself is the name of a typical Dutch sandwich while toast means toast
For the menu offered at Huize Jon there are various processed coffees such as Original Wine Robusta Coffe Van Den Berg Wine Robusta Coffe French Press Americano and several other processed coffees However for the superior menu at this place visitors need to try the Dutch special Huize Jon coffe which is Dutch coffee slightly adjusted to be suitable for consumption by the people of Malang For menus other than coffee there are several other choices such as milkshakes tea chocolate or even ginger Apart from drinks this place also provides a food menu such as french fries indomie spring rolls sandwiches and several other menu choices written in Dutch such as Gebakken aardappelen Vleeskroketjes met mustard Pannekoek and various other choices

Coffee shop that has old skool vibes serves a variety of coffee and noncoffee drinks and other snacks at affordable prices

Talking about the menu you will find a lot of mixed drink menus both cold milk coffee variants and noncoffee variants created by Wafa Dont forget there are also heavy meals and snacks you know For heavy meals there are rice bowls with several flavors which to be honest tastes good to me pol mesio I havent tried it in a long time and for snacks you can guess for yourself
For the price Wafa prices its drinks and food at around 15 thousand to 25 thousand if Im not mistaken

The service is good its just that Wafa currently seems to be hampered by the number of human resources so sometimes you have to wait a little longer for your order to arrive
But apparently thats a plus point you know So you can chat first with your friends or something like that

Actually Wafa has a really nice atmosphere Its good for being alone its good for being together but its a shame that Wafas location is on the side of a road which is quite busy with driving activity so its sometimes a bit noisy

I think the sugar uses palm sugar and I happen to really like palm sugar thats it for the prologue lets come on  to the review

Place review 
So this outlet has a unique and cool model in my opinion its more like a Korean theme alay like that the seats use private material and the original is nice to look at but this material if it gets hit by rain it will rot and break
This outlet is staffed by mothers and children the mother may be in charge of taking care of food such as donuts waffles etc while the cute and virgin part of the baristastyle drinks its a shame the two of them dont wear cool uniforms like outlets the other one instead wears short shorts wkwkwk tomorrow just wear lingerie so its badaasss but they still feel clumsy in the halter eh not flexible when making the order process the plus point is that the motherchild duo are friendly  one more this outlet is more for take away as a table There are no chairs there are only chairs for waiting for the order only 2 birds

Food review the drinks are manstab abiz semanstab the video is cut tari vs ariel noah oops  the process of making waffles and donuts takes quite a long time even though I saw them using modern equipment I can imagine if you get a lot of orders it will definitely be more complicated and the process will be more delayed takes a long time

Thats all warm greetings from Garangan Elegant

The coffee taste is strong the quality is also the best There are donuts  cirengnya also delicious Keep up the quality  quality

So this outlet has a unique and cool model in my opinion its more like a Korean theme alay like that the seats use private material and the original is nice to look at but this material if it gets hit by rain it will rot and break
This outlet is staffed by mothers and children the mother may be in charge of taking care of food such as donuts waffles etc while the cute and virgin part of the baristastyle drinks its a shame the two of them dont wear cool uniforms like outlets the other one instead wears short shorts wkwkwk tomorrow just wear lingerie so its badaasss but they still feel clumsy in the halter eh not flexible when making the order process the plus point is that the motherchild duo are friendly  one more this outlet is more for take away as a table There are no chairs there are only chairs for waiting for the order only 2 birds

Food review the drinks are manstab abiz semanstab the video is cut tari vs ariel noah oops  the process of making waffles and donuts takes quite a long time even though I saw them using modern equipment I can imagine if you get a lot of orders it will definitely be more complicated and the process will be more delayed takes a long time

Thats all warm greetings from Garangan Elegant

The coffee taste is strong the quality is also the best There are donuts  cirengnya also delicious Keep up the quality  quality

The coffee is delicious the side dishes are also delicious the prices are also reasonable its not surprising that talented artists have several times ordered drinks especially coffee from Daycinno the best anyway

once my friend bought a blak but not as much as i expected wkw
the noodles are also normal
drink it okay
the 2nd floor table is not cleaned enough sometimes I want to eat there are still lots of leftovers the soup from the previous customer the point is that it is not very clean where the tissue is provided at the cashier its okay at the cashier but the cleanliness of the table for eating customers should pay more attention even so I often come here to buy Baso acinya hHahaha

Edit per July 3rd 2022
Theres a new coffee drink they added called Marios Specialty Why the name Go and find it out by yourself theres a story behind it It tastes quite easy on the tongue with all the goodness of what the coffee beans may offer plus the richness of milk and some other secret ingredients only they  Virginia and Evan the owner  know You can customized the level of sweetness standardhalfquarter to suit your own taste Check out the last photo I added for a quick sample of the drink My grade for this one 9 out of 10 Love it It is my new standard drink whenever I visit the place You should check it out too Im sure you wont disappointed on this one Happy trying and let me know your thought on it

Small coffee shop in a neighborhood The coffee is quite nice and the service is very good on my two visits The price is excellent There is only outdoor seating for about 6 people total Staying in this neighborhood its perfect to just swing by and grab a quick coffee

Great place to find a flavor coffee and japanese dishes they have Great

Nice coffee

Before coming here I often ordered food and drinks from this cafe via the Gojek application Out of curiosity about the place I finally took the time to come to enjoy it in person And I dont regret it

This cafe has a relatively small place There are two tables with several benches So my advice if you want to come in a group no more than 4 people Even though its small my experience here is still fun and filling

The food and drink menu available here is quite affordable with great taste Because Ive ordered via the Gojek application so Im familiar with the menus One of the recommended and favorite menus here is Butter Rice Chicken Katsu And its just chefs kiss The portion is enough to fill a hungry students stomach after doing the assignment

The owner and Ocil the black and white cat who likes to stop by here are very friendly Ocil seems too friendly just met him and fell asleep on my lap  But that made my experience even more memorable

For those who want to chat casually with friends while drinking fresh coffee and eating heavy or light this place is perfect for you Ill definitely come back here",0.975,0.0008684073409367,0.682760522202281,1423,"coffee eating, place enjoy, coffee great, match coffee, coffee group, visit place, drink visit, private coffee, cafe, coffee spot"

Everytime i come to this place for event b1g1 from line starbuck i never have to pay full bcause i love discount and anyone love half price right  This place is clean and neat good place for meet up hangout and doing your homework Otherwise the coffee taste for me its okay but the price is too overprices NOT RECOMMENDED FOR POOR PEOPLE HHHH 

The best layout so far for me the baristas even willing to set the air con temperature for me so I can sit on my favourite spot However lately the Air Con is suddenly set to a colder temp sooo freezing I wonder if this is based on popular request

What a great place to enjoy your lunch break or waiting your movie
As we can know Starbucks WiFi is so fast and easy to use
There is a toilet inside the cafe so its very convenient for us that we dont need walk to far
And is it near with ARAYA Regency and Binus Malang University
There are a long table in the center of building that is suitable for meeting with more than 5 peoples

good place good ambience
they say this one has the best croissant in town  and indeed its good
try grandmas favorite yum

as for the place very nice for chilling good coffee and very good service from the staffs 

and they opened their 2nd level for more table and seats on my last visit love it always a good time here 

We looking forward to try the almond croissant but unfortunately it already sold out So we try strawberry danish and meat pie which pretty decent but still not what we expect from the lot of good reviews written Personally prefer the pastry to be more flaky and the filling both sweet or savour more balanced Place is indeed pretty picturesque if you like to take a photo but not that much place for dine in I recommend to come in the morning if you want to try all their selection and want to dine in

My fave pastry place They have various options of pastry super tasty with affordable price The place is cozy and instagramable its a nice place for hangout in the afternoon or after office time Unfortunately the coffee isnt so good And sometimes most of the bestseller items are sold out but they usually restock it again at noon If you want to try their various or bestseller items i suggest to come around 911am But i still love this place everything beside the coffee is nice the pastries the place the staff even the parking man is friendly n has a good manner

good place good ambience
they say this one has the best croissant in town  and indeed its good
try grandmas favorite yum

as for the place very nice for chilling good coffee and very good service from the staffs 

and they opened their 2nd level for more table and seats on my last visit love it always a good time here 

We looking forward to try the almond croissant but unfortunately it already sold out So we try strawberry danish and meat pie which pretty decent but still not what we expect from the lot of good reviews written Personally prefer the pastry to be more flaky and the filling both sweet or savour more balanced Place is indeed pretty picturesque if you like to take a photo but not that much place for dine in I recommend to come in the morning if you want to try all their selection and want to dine in

My fave pastry place They have various options of pastry super tasty with affordable price The place is cozy and instagramable its a nice place for hangout in the afternoon or after office time Unfortunately the coffee isnt so good And sometimes most of the bestseller items are sold out but they usually restock it again at noon If you want to try their various or bestseller items i suggest to come around 911am But i still love this place everything beside the coffee is nice the pastries the place the staff even the parking man is friendly n has a good manner

Overall its a nice place to work study or even organization meeting since a lot of student come to this place for that

The only minus two are the parking area is kinda small and the place is kinda hot although the ambience looks nice

Homey coffee shop just located in housing area Feels like you drink your coffee inside your own house even theres a shower in the toilet There are three spot you can choose here first is outside in front of the carport second is inside the house and the third its gonna be the little back yard The decoration pretty nice and lovely About the drinks and beverages obviously there are a coffee based and non coffee based I ordered a brahma which is like cranberry with a tonic water i belive and its really refreshing Also theres a potato wedges and chocolate toast that quite good I love the potato wedges theres like a delicious bolognese sauce Overall its pretty great

You can get to this place because you got lost following the gmaps so stop by As for the place its quite easy to reach the weather is cool the cafe design is okay
But apologize in advance my honest review of the price is not suitable for students The menu was less varied and I was confused about choosing a menu because my stomach didnt go well with coffee and chocolate As a result I ordered chocolate ice  baso aci Baso aci at a price of 20 thousand that I ordered was too expensive because it wasnt worth the filling But the chocolate ice is pretty good
It is hoped that my review can be used as a consideration for evaluating this cafe so that in the future it can grow  be even better Success always

Cozy place Cool not noisy Suitable for refreshing Suitable for family events

Dizzy Coffee French Fries IDR 10000 But PORTIONS ARE MALANG RAYA CHAMPIONS

Wow I never thought that in the Ciliwung area Malang there is really good coffee

Product I ordered Es Coffee Coconut it tasted really good my friend who doesnt like coffee that much took a sip and immediately said mmmm yummmm That means its really good because my friend is the most fussy about food and drink

Price the price is standard but in accordance with the taste The price for Ice Coffee Coconut is only IDR 18000 guys French fries are only IDR 10000 but the portion Masha Allah is a lot guys and the taste is really good too

Place even though I ordered take away but at first glance I saw that the place was quite comfortable for hanging out and the location is on the side of the road so its really easy to find

Service friendly service even though I came with flip flops and all black clothes

Please those who miss good coffee can immediately attack the place

The drinks are great

The place is difficult to find a car park Very roadside location

For the price its still above the lower limit for cafe prices in Malang yes but its worth it because the place is good bro the coffee is also good Price range if Im not mistaken 15k30s

The atmosphere is calm even though the roadside is a bit congested and almost always crowded especially near gacoan you know how to do gacoan for yourself

The only minus is the space which is not too big and not too small while the plus is that there is an individual seat facing the wall The seats are actually proportional to the overall space but I personally think its a bit too small

The majority of seats are outdoor indoor non smoking only 1 seat set I guess

The service is a little above standard which is good because the standard is actually already good If you pay using QRIS QR Code the qr code is printed specifically for customer transactions so you dont need to enter a nominal again like in most cafes today

Thanks for the experience

Nice clean place although not too big Easy access to the side of the road even though from the main road it doesnt look too much like an ordinary shophouse later there are stairs below for access to nongki  to the swimming pool for the children The view of the rice fields really likes it if there is a cafe with a view of nature that can be used for healing Drinks  food are pretty standard prices from 10 thousand25 thousand The snack menu has a few choices try adding union rings chocolate cheese bananas crispy tofu medoan tempeh or cheese cassava There is no VAT at this time Its just a shame it opens at 3 in the afternoon Lack of promotion on social media too Try near the swimming pool give a table and chairs with umbrellas like that 

order came quickly
so no need to wait long
if you want to eat while looking at the rice fields
really can
There is a pool although its not that big
suitable for my child who likes to play water
there is an outdoor one that is indoor
if its hot there  so it can really be indoor
but if its cloudy and it doesnt rain its nice outside
while looking at the natural scenery
The children are comfortable not confused about asking them to go home
eat like recreation
close to home too
so not tired
place on the highway
across from the orange market
Please have a try

The place is small but comfortable especially for waiting in line or flash bites between patient shifts

The decoration of the room is cool utilizing the corner space on the 2nd floor The furniture is also a combination of classic and modern which really blends together

But whats a bit annoying is actually the barista might be even cooler if you use a barista apron with the cafe branding Because several times the barista came here wearing the UMM Hospital employee uniform batik So it kind of loses the feel of the cafe a bit 

For the menu I like caramel macchiato the most The sweetness is just right a little sweet but still safe not as sweet as in cafes in general

Surprised to see the very spacious area of this cafe I like their cozy setting plenty of seating options and the playlist wifi and electrical socket are suitable to do some work

Price is very affordable and their matcha tastes quite good

However the food menu is limited and most of them are stored cold they just reheat them when we order Also the bathroom is only available on the first floor

Nice cafe with great ambience Not too crowded so its suitable for studying The food is average but the tea is delicious Definitely will go back here The place is quite hidden in the 2nd floor of a building

It is located on the second floor of Wikacell on Soekarno Hatta street Its a cozy place to work study or just hangout with friends Menus are varied and reasonably priced There is a toilet on the first floor and a prayer room on the third floor Overall this cafe is very comfortable

Nice place for working while having a coffee and pastry

I ordered mie goreng and tea the tea taste really good Mie goreng was abit salty next time should try the coffee I went there before christmas they put nice christmas ornaments

The atmosphere there is good
But the food there is not really satisfying Honey chicken was either overfried or fried again and the taste is very ordinary Not going to pay a cafe price for that kind of food quality
There heritage noodles also taste just like mie goreng from any other street food stores Sorry to say taste and potion are better in those food stores
So not very recommend to eat there

Definitely one of the most unique cafes out there Many instagrammable spots inside this cafe

Enjoyed some work time in front of my laptop woth some snacks and drinks Veru comfortable place

The foods and drinks are also great The service from the staff is also veru welcoming and friendly Definitely will be back

Cozy placecomfort foodworthy price Instagramable spotkids friendlyvery recommended 

I ordered mie goreng and tea the tea taste really good Mie goreng was abit salty next time should try the coffee I went there before christmas they put nice christmas ornaments

The atmosphere there is good
But the food there is not really satisfying Honey chicken was either overfried or fried again and the taste is very ordinary Not going to pay a cafe price for that kind of food quality
There heritage noodles also taste just like mie goreng from any other street food stores Sorry to say taste and potion are better in those food stores
So not very recommend to eat there

It looks so narrow from outside but when you go in its pretty spacious They have izakayastreet decoration and numerous of neon lights Main space is smoking area but they have separated nonsmoking area as well The vibe is so loud with hiphop music and it fits the decoration so well

They mainly sell alcoholic beverages but dont worry they also provide non alcoholic Their cocktail was good all drinks were good on my visit Quite cheap 30kcup for cocktail Very recommended

A brand new place in a center of Malang City strategic place with easy road access
Great place to hangout and drink with friends it has very nice concept and decoration You can feel really different ambience downstairs makes you lost track in time There will be no difference ambience between day and night amazing isnt it Not only they have very nice place they also provide you with extraordinary food and drinks Loud music is a plus to this kind of vibe cant complain 

definitely not my usual kind of scene  i personally cant stand being there for too long since its placed underground and a lot of people smokes there its very stuffy the snack is great though and the drink is okay

New experience for hangout
The cafe with downtown of Tokyos vibes

The Place
The entrance soooooo small I even passing the place twice to make sure of it
So many LEDs to take a picture with Great vibes
Unfortunately not for people who come to chitchat with friends because the music is too loud for me

The Taste
The Miso Ramen taste sooo good The Drink also good and fancy

The Price
Reasonable You can get the fancy dish for around 20k50k

The Service
The service is ok The waiter and cashier are so friendly

Yoo this place was very awesome and very interesting concept I like it very much just like their name place Downtown yep it was underground and just like pub but they sell coffee amd that was very unique taste The food was delicious too have indoor smoking area great place to hangout with a bunch of friends like a big group of it Enjoyy at here while you at Malang",0.925,0.0274416719736004,0.6557325015920801,2101,"downtown yep, ambience downstairs, delicious indoor, tokyos vibes, place hangout, place awesome, spacious izakayastreet, opened cafebar, malang city, cafebar"

One of the cafes in Suhat is located next to the Sahid Montana hotel  This cafe is not too wide but very homey  The table provided is enough for groups and alone  The menu offered is interesting tastes good and has many choices  Chocolate and coffee based drinks are highly recommended  For snacks I recommend churros and fries  One thing that is a little annoying for me personally sometimes too many people smoke so the smoke gathers until the table and my clothes smell of cigarette smoke for passive smokers like me its quite disturbing  Maybe there needs to be another way and regulation to handle my complaint  thanks

First of all nice interior concept just like an old gold mining site I drank their coldbrew and it tastes great mild and fruity Next time Ill go there Id love to enjoy my coldbrew without an ice cube it might taste a lot better Overall as a newcomers they offer a great Australian culture coffeeshop You should go there

Have been trying their several different menus and heres my top three so far
1 Iced hojicha its creamy and thick the flavour is quite deep not overly sweetjust a perfect bittersweet combination
2 French fries with this yellow sauce and mozzarella I forgot the actual name in the menu  because cheese will never be wrong
3 Beef kebab the sauce is exceptional

Unfortunately I cant give any review about their coffee because tbh my body cannot cooperate at all with any coffee intake but I can still say this is a nice place to spend the time The place is not really wide but its super cozy and calmingsuch a perfect workspace Not too crowded but its not empty either Staffs and owner are very humble and friendly and they will explain anything if you ask them about the menu I had a really good time here and I wont be hesitating to visit this place again and try their other menus",0.925,0.0228101661552712,0.6543430498465813,2116,"coffee intake, grounded coffee, cooperate coffee, coldbrew tastes, brew nya, hotel cafe, review coffee, cafes suhat, blend cafes, iced coffee"

One of the cafes in Suhat is located next to the Sahid Montana hotel  This cafe is not too wide but very homey  The table provided is enough for groups and alone  The menu offered is interesting tastes good and has many choices  Chocolate and coffee based drinks are highly recommended  For snacks I recommend churros and fries  One thing that is a little annoying for me personally sometimes too many people smoke so the smoke gathers until the table and my clothes smell of cigarette smoke for passive smokers like me its quite disturbing  Maybe there needs to be another way and regulation to handle my complaint  thanks

First of all nice interior concept just like an old gold mining site I drank their coldbrew and it tastes great mild and fruity Next time Ill go there Id love to enjoy my coldbrew without an ice cube it might taste a lot better Overall as a newcomers they offer a great Australian culture coffeeshop You should go there

Have been trying their several different menus and heres my top three so far
1 Iced hojicha its creamy and thick the flavour is quite deep not overly sweetjust a perfect bittersweet combination
2 French fries with this yellow sauce and mozzarella I forgot the actual name in the menu  because cheese will never be wrong
3 Beef kebab the sauce is exceptional

Unfortunately I cant give any review about their coffee because tbh my body cannot cooperate at all with any coffee intake but I can still say this is a nice place to spend the time The place is not really wide but its super cozy and calmingsuch a perfect workspace Not too crowded but its not empty either Staffs and owner are very humble and friendly and they will explain anything if you ask them about the menu I had a really good time here and I wont be hesitating to visit this place again and try their other menus",0.925,0.0228101661552712,0.6543430498465813,2118,"coffee intake, grounded coffee, cooperate coffee, coldbrew tastes, brew nya, hotel cafe, review coffee, cafes suhat, blend cafes, iced coffee"

I quite curious of this place I accompanied my friend to try this place The first you can see the whole place its nice There is a room like private room for us who need doing homework and outdoor I ordered rice bowl chicken skin and coffe latte The taste of food is not good little kurang pas so I hope they can improve the taste in their food Then the price is quite expensive because its far from the city area with that price and I compared with other cafe I think its quite expensive But all is good And I want come again another time

 located in residence area so the surrounding not too crowded
 cheap
 must try their signature drinks
 friendly staff
 their big table in the middle is dirty because its broke
 lack of snack menu
 no AC in indoor area

Another coffee shop in Malang theres so many coffee shop here
This place little bit small on the inside for the coffees are decent
Price not so expensive and not cheap middle
Inside theres air conditioning room so you cant smoke inside obviously
I bought iced coffee caramel and taste like regular iced coffee
The location are so easy to spot theres parking spot for car

This place is good if youre hanging out with your friends In my pov as an introvert youre not going to enjoy your time alone here or intimate moment with your girlfriend I had no prob with the drinks but it wasnt special either

This place only serves drinks mainly coffee based and snacks They offer lunch meals which you cant choose what to eat they only cook one menu each day D

The newest Starbucks in town and the first Starbucks which provides drive thru in Malang If you want to dinein dont worry Its really spacious The location is not really difficult to find Lets say its in the main road in Malang

The first Starbucks Drive Thru in town the place is nice and cozy Nice place to hanging out after office There are indoor and outdoor area both of them are cozy Indoor area sometimes is too freezing because the air con is still new and works too well  The toilet is nice clean and smells good The parking area  is not too big probably not enough parking lot for weekend Most of the baristas are friendly and helpful",0.925,0.0151102877322989,0.6520330863196897,2152,"area cozy, cozy indoor, spacious location, cafe clean, weekend baristas, newest starbucks, starbucks provides, baristas friendly, work cafe, starbucks malang"

This place is hidden in a small cluster of houses I ask the barista how come this place situated like this and the answer is the owner of this coffee shop is also the owner of the housings development no wonder

I order the package consisting of one coffee latte with a croissant and I also order 1 berry soda juice

All taste great and the croissants is really big

good ambiance pretty place good service yummy food

The day went a little further than usual
To the city of Malang

We are heading to Malang
Precisely in the village of Dauh
Enter Noor Resident

Nara Coffees name
Right at the end of the housing
Looks like this place is managed by the housing side

First time
Instantly wow

Tiny Place
Feel so hommy
Can talk
While enjoying the cool air

I ordered picollo
And chocolate ice
Cookies

The picollo is delicious i like it
Hahahahaha
Ice chocolate is delicious when its sweet
And for the right price

This place is fun
For us to talk
And relax

So what are you waiting for
Please try

And this is my opinion
Please try it yourself

Not so spacious place the iced coffee is okay also the cheesecake But it has so calm ambient since its in a small residence

Had a cup of nice Piccolo and croissant with affordable price The only thing that bother me is the flies at outdoor",0.925,0.0148208186186533,0.651946245585596,2153,"picollo delicious, latte croissant, coffees right, place situated, chocolate ice, place iced, bromo lunch, ask barista, owner coffee, picollo chocolate"

Homey is one word to describe this place since the the location is exactly inside a residential area A tad bit too small to me though Ordered Bakpao Tiga Jaya and Es Milo Malaysia and wow the bakpao is big I say BIG and I absolutely love it it tastes great too The Es Milo Malaysia tastes nice as well The only thing missing was the cats where are them I was looking forward to meeting the cats thats usually shown in their Instagram Or maybe I just came at the wrong moment Would visit again for the cats

The place is quite small but not that bad I like their milo iced

They have single origin coffees from around Indonesia which can be brewed in five different ways This was fun to tour We tried the Kintamani brewed in a siphon which was mild with a mango juice they prepared with 100 mango and cream So refreshing Its a little expensive as they have some extra charges for certain taxes which was explained in the menu Just dont be surprised by the bill

The ambiance is the strongest point along with a great menu of drinks and food

Cosy open air caf with extensive menu for both international and local food We came here for the espressos and they really hit the spot We indulged on an affogato and ginger latte as well as some delicious pancakes and roti bantal with chocolate

Wonderful decor and experience for a foreigner like me to see the batik masks and other traditional puppets We went between meals but The food looked amazing and I would love to go back and try it

They have tropicalindustrial decoration really like cafes in Canggu and the coconut tree there really fits with the vibe They sell mainly nonalcoholic drinks but they provide cold beers as well Kinda pricey if its compared with any other cafe in Malang but still reasonable Definitely a must visit if you have an occasion in Malang

Good vibes cafe The only constraint is hard to fine car parking here So my suggestion if you wanted to come here just bring motorcycle or public transportation
Food taste is good very nice vibes  homey and nature

Good food good place good service Cafe with homie vibes

Will definitely be my favourite coffee shop in Malang The coffee is superb Try pour over V60 Gayo wine beans Sooo light and clear And surprisingly its not really expensive for such a fragrant and tasty coffee The place So much greeny and peaceful Its got a concept a vintage house A house during Dutch colonization I feel like in my grandmas house in the village

Its nice the menu is delicious and cheap like the others its just that the place isnt cozy especially the badminton chairs  and the lights are too bright so its like an open space The live music also makes it comfortable the singer makes visitors feel at home

The place is quite comfortable there is live music food can also be",0.925,0.005557806981995,0.6491673420945985,2275,"isnt cozy, sitting area, chill vibes, menu cheap, place isnt, parking area, makes visitors, comfortable live, music food, music parking"

good coffee with good view

Very recommended

Good and cozy place

the entry location is in the alley but easy to find via the map for r4 users parking is rather difficult because the road is rather narrow
Some of the menus are empty so there are only messages
food 710  drinks 7510
the view on the 2nd floor is okay directly facing the main road and to the toll road
The atmosphere of the cafe is classic

I feel SYAHDU ATMOSPHERE when I enjoy poor coarse coffee at the shop which is located in this small alley

Because the location is inaccessible to vehicles its better to park on the side of the main road or in the main square

Arriving at the location we can choose whether we want to sit on the available benches  tables or take a stool plastic chair and find our own seat along the aisle

Even though the price of the black brewed coffee is affordable Rp 4000 the taste is very authentic The coffee tastes thick according to my taste

uh for the price Dont worry its guaranteed to be really affordable starting at 600014000 hopefully my memory isnt wrong for sure it wont drain the bag even if you order it repeatedly hehe

flavor even though the place seems very simple it feels like it can really compete lots of unique ones like Lowak Ice I think its because everyone will have a different review hehe

capacity wuuu spacious place often also for events can accommodate up to 60 people

Its not too crowded the service is friendly The place is really okay For the taste of food  drinks maybe there will be more effort

One of the good cafes for work every seat has an outlet too food and drink prices are quite affordable there are indoor and outdoor seating options Service is friendly and fast tissue paper and hand washing soap are provided in the toilet the toilet is also clean the wifi is also smooth good for assignments and discussions but its a bit noisy because its near the highway But overall its worth it for a visit Dont forget to ask for the wifi password ohh every aesthetic seat can take photos

 The chicken tender rice for the sauce is too runny and bland but the rice and chicken are delicious
 The matcha drink is too sweet and doesnt taste like the matcha more to the sweet taste of the milk
 For service it was still lacking at that time my order was not delivered to the table I thought it was self service but it turned out that there was a customer behind me whose order was delivered to his table even though it was quiet at that time and the employee sat in front of the cashier and when he came home too play hp Hopefully in the future there will be no customer exceptions

cozy and good coffee

The place is very comfortable clean and also seems simple not a fancy cafe The coffee menu is very diverse and is also served from various coffee beans that we can choose for ourselves For the price it is still standard in the class of cafe cafes that sell contemporary coffee

But yesterday when I ordered manual brew v60 the taste of the coffee was still lacking in my opinion either because the coffee beans were not fresh or something else that I didnt know

Even though Awal Bermula is located on a busy street across Pasar Blimbing once you are inside it is quiet Their food and drink were okay between 2030K It also has some seatings on the 2nd floor
One major turnoff is parking Parking space is tiny fit two cars and twothree motorcycles or six motorcycles Take ridehailing service will save you from headache

The beverages is good the vibe in such a place is amazing for a dinner and chill time Customer can enjoy the view from above to the road

From the outside it looks like an ordinary small cafe but it turns out to be a very proper restaurant The interior is super nice and well laid out clean and tidy the green tones are really pretty

The service is very good you dont have to wait too long for the food  drinks to come out The ambiance is really nice and makes you feel at home for long The music played is mostly jazz perfect for casual conversation

For food and drinks tend to be pricey It looks okay but the taste is really ordinary for that price The hazelnut milkshake has lots of ice cubes then the cream itself is half a glass As far as I know a milkshake should have milk and ice cream blended together not hazelnut milk add ice cubes and then add whipped cream to half a cup The straws use paper straws its good to care for the environment but it makes it hard to drink the cream

If the latte is okay served with cookies and sugar separately It feels great

Is one of the Cheese Tea booths which is quite popular in Malang City There are various cheese tea drink menus available and the prices are quite affordable For purchases you can take in or through the ojol application because it is only in the form of a booth  stall the place to stop is very limited and the parking space follows the existing stall There are no toilets or prayer rooms available Even so now Cheese Tea is quite popular with young people
Thats a review from me hope it helps

Really recommend it feels like the location is also strategic after the macaroni ngehe

However the food menu is limited and most of them are stored cold they just reheat them when we order Also the bathroom is only available on the first floor

Nice cafe with great ambience Not too crowded so its suitable for studying The food is average but the tea is delicious Definitely will go back here The place is quite hidden in the 2nd floor of a building

It is located on the second floor of Wikacell on Soekarno Hatta street Its a cozy place to work study or just hangout with friends Menus are varied and reasonably priced There is a toilet on the first floor and a prayer room on the third floor Overall this cafe is very comfortable

Nice place for working while having a coffee and pastry

The staffs are friendly some tables r equipped w electric socket
The place is also clean n neat
They provide trash bin for the customers to throw the plastic glass after drinking
I love it that they use paper straw instead of the one made of plastic

Strategically located in the crowded places like university and schools Great variation of sofas chairs and tables to choose from Very delicious coffee

The only drawback is the space Its actually big enough but all of the crowd and promotions renders this place less spacious

Other foods are also delicious The portion is reasonable for the price
The cafe is quite crowded during the weekend The parking space inside the cafe area is enough for 68 cars You can park along the side of the road or across the street
The staff is just OK not significantly Javanese friendly 
They should just smile a little when taking order and serving the food 

Good vibes only services kinda slow because its near lebaran places kinda far from the city center

Life changing No exaggeration I never eaten paru before and never liked organs But my girlfriend introduced me to kopi sontoloyos nasi paru and it really is very delicious Now everytime i go to malang ill spare a day to visit here to eat the nasi paru as well as take away some frozen one to bring back to Jakarta It really is really good

The resto is not big Cozy enough for friends and family to hang out for coffee or big meals
We ordered Asian chicken curry calamari rice fish n fries Delicious  The mashed potato was savory and the consistency is just right Not too soft
The food presentation is also very nice
The lime drink is served in a large jug unlike some resto we visited before Very generous portion not too much ice cubes

The interior is vintage There is a collection of motorcycles in front of the main entrance Its nice to see if youre into bikers But I think it took up too much space The outdoor area has only 2 sets of tables We chose outdoor because the nonsmoking area is not available

It was our first time and we got a pouch of signature coffee powder for free because we spent more than 250k

My favorite beverage from this cafe is Milkshake I didnt find a matcha milkshake for this cafe When I was a college student this cafe was always crowded but cozy and quiet

I recommended Work From Cafe in this place This cafe must maintain the furniture and interior but for the taste always be lovely for waitpersons must smile and be friendly to the customer BTW this cafe must pay attention to the plating

Nice and cozy place and they have smoking outdoor and nonsmoking indoor areas separated Free Wifi and power outlets are available I think the number of the tables is a little bit small not surprising because the place is not big Nevertheless with the right and nice interiors and light it feels spacious enough They apply the new normal protocol so we found that some tables are not in used I think the chair could be imrpoved though I certainly like it if it more comfortable especially if I want to do my work in the place
We tried the apple pie which is part of the pastries displayed at the front counter It was scrumptious with the perfect crispy flaky dough and the right sweetness and sourness of the apple filling The caesar salad comes as a combination of lettuces generous amount of grilled chicken and a slice of garlic bread but with different dressing than the usual yellow caesar dressing I used to know It uses some kind of mayonnaise combined with certain herbs and spices I think Kinda tasted the parsley in the dressing somehow It tasted nice and fresh
The salted spicy tofu is good although I prefer mine to be a little bit more salty It comes with a separate sauce made of sweet soy sauce and chili flakes The vegetables cream soup tasted good but the texture is somehow quite thick reminds me of a very thick porridge instead of soup Theyre certainly generous with the amount of the vegetables however
The chocolatemilk is quite nice while the iced lemon tea is proved to be a hit for me definitely want to order it again Were lucky enough to get a free ice cream waffle with minimum 100K rupiahs purchase choose between chocolate strawberry or banana one The strawberry waffle comes with strawberry ice cream strawberry slices strawberry jam and whipped cream that I found very rare used in the waffle sold here in the city The offer will last until the end of August by the way

This place is cozy and classy You can see yellowish color across the room so it makes you hungry as soon as you enter the room and almost dont wanna leave it  but if you want to sit comfortably you may come at afternoon or evening here since this place is too crowded at night Dont worry about the food and beverages quality 5 stars are for all menu Standing applause

The salted spicy tofu is good although I prefer mine to be a little bit more salty It comes with a separate sauce made of sweet soy sauce and chili flakes The vegetables cream soup tasted good but the texture is somehow quite thick reminds me of a very thick porridge instead of soup Theyre certainly generous with the amount of the vegetables however

It was a good place to kill the time with your mates The place is quite easy to reach and also comfortable to chill or doing some work The menu is interesting because youll find different variant of coffee that rarely served at another coffee shop in malang like salted caramel coffee and also caramel macchiato which as far I know I can only find it at starbucks coffee The minus is the lighting at night that just not the same the indoor and outdoor area thats just look not so good And also the concept of the indoor area was so so I mean not really special But over all the caramel macchiato was good 

I tried their latte and it was real good It was served in a cute cup without a teaspoon as other cafes would do But I enjoyed it much Also their cireng bumbu rujak is refreshing

Good place with homey vibe and of course the Cappuccino is great for me with such price

Nice little coffee shops ample outdoor space decent power outlets good selection of beverage The baristas were kind and polite just make sure to ask them if there is any requests about your order theyll be happy to help you or you just want to chit chat with them The only downside is there isnt any decent parking space you must park your vehicle beside the road and the road just too damn narrow 35 2 points for the availability of the parking space All and all very recommended",0.8999999999999999,0.0332310542465119,0.6399693162739535,2675,"know starbucks, teaspoon cafes, man cafe, coffee minus, starbucks, coffee caramel, served coffee, caramel coffee, cafes enjoyed, concept coffee"

The ambience is not really great for work or study because its pretty crowded but if you go here only for hanging out its quiet good 710 for the americano 710 for the sweet karaage The place will crowded quickly as soon as it opened Better reserved a table first before come here

 Love the color palette of this cafe
 The bar is so cute
 Love the Wastafel area
 Indoor and outdoor
 Cute concept
 Limited parking lot
 Their food is not quite tasty
 Some furniture finishing is ugly

I came here when this coffe shop just open about a week so during my visit this cafe always busy I like their concept about recycling old house into new cafe without break down the house
Love their outdoor ceiling because they use clear ceiling

A coffee shop that has a unique concept in Malang is different from other coffee shops It gets an 810 for ambiance because its cute and unique There are also quite a lot of seats provided but the place is not too wide for a coffee shop because it is located in a residential area It looks like this coffee shop is only suitable for chatting with friends and not for doing assignments because the place is quite noisy and crowded so its not comfortable if you need a place thats not noisy For food and drink I give a rating of 910 because it is delicious and unique and the price is cheap Various kinds of drinks and food are provided here From snacks to heavy meals and in my opinion all the menus dont fail because they match their appearance with what is on the menu Service 8510 due to selfservice drinks and food delivered by the waitress Besides that for those of you who like to take pictures here a photobox is provided for which of course a separate fee is charged

I do like this cafe Small but so comfort I can say that I will be enjoy and no boring to spend a half day here The food and drinks are so good

They accept ovo as well which is good

Well it provides everything you need for a proper steady and quiet environment for a zoom meeting The ambiance is not fancy but suprisingly comforting for online meetings purposes Affordable standard menu range from basic cappucino to their signature drink

It is very basic but yet only few places in town who offer this kind of services

Good place for casual meet Good food with good price but the the coffee that I ordered was not really good A little bit long bitter taste eventhough the beans should be good

Good coffee good place

Had a nice time coming here 2 times Menu is averaged pricing between 20rb to 40rb mainly serving coffee Staff are nice and give a friendly vibe Indoors also has a nice cold spacious room with a 2nd floor to go to Outdoors has 2 sides 1 in the front and the other on the side which I recommend more Toilet is also clean and spacious but keep in mind that theres no toilet paper as of what I remember

This is a strategically placed coffee shop on the side of main road and near some of the beautiful places in Malang Unfortunately their coffee is not very tasty I would describe their coffee as plain They offer some tea and chocolate based product which I recommend more than their coffee",0.8999999999999999,0.0253574943553522,0.6376072483066055,2715,"online meetings, dua ruang, clean spacious, unfortunately coffee, recommend toilet, visiting dua, tasty coffee, placed coffee, meetings dua, price coffee"

The drink variants are coffee mix yakult mix ice cream mix milk variant The toast has sweet variants such as chocolate and cheese then savory variants such as egg chicken or beef The sauce topping is very delicious I recommend the chicken cheese toast with a creamy mushroom sauce If you dont like sweet toast

The choco  cheese toast is very sweet because the chocolate paste is very much Be careful with your sensitive teeth 

And  I really love the toast packaging

I ordered ice milk coffee called Pasti Kopi Susu and it turned out good

Surprisingly at this nylempit place you can find  a cozy place to hang with your friends or just doing your stuff on laptop

The coffee they serve is quite interesting You can find es kopi susu with brown sugar here Si refreshing

Their accident coffee maksudnya kopi tubruk is quite strong Its aroma is very good

Lots of interesting drinks Coffee tea or me 

But the camilans they serve is rather limited Their cinnamon roll bun is quite nice You can cokot it than use fork or spoon

I like their interior design Especially at evening You can get beautiful selfieselfie here

Nice place

And very helpful and friendly owner

Well I think this place is pretty much great except for the fact that the air conditioner is not working It was a rainy afternoon I needed place for my homework and I remembered my friend told me about this place a long time ago They have small room and limited table which is fine to me but with limited air circulation I am getting sweaty and sweaty then I decided to leave Fix the air conditioner and perhaps Ill go there again someday

Even though its location takes more effort to reach from the main street youll be glad to discover some of their finest beverages especially coffee I personally choose their Pasti Kopi Susu as it suits my taste so well it has a gentle flavor which is hard to describe here so just find out yourself The atmosphere of this place is great many good spot to take beauty shot or a perfect selfie for your social media needs I love their fast wifi connection and calm indie music playing in the background Both barista are also cheerful and definitely the person youll be willing to tell your story with

The place is nice cozy and clean The menus are affordable and taste really good although it may take some time 3045 minutes per menu to be served Its a good place for having online workclass or even family gatherings

the place is comfortable for chatting and looking for a new atmosphere especially because it is located next to the train tracks not suitable for those of you who want to do something with a laptop because there are no electrical plugs

I like the view Kopi Baja Hitam is my best view LOL 

but seriously when I first saw this place I really love it Theres so many cafes by the train tracks in Malang but I think Kopi Baja Hitams ambience suits my taste To be honest the design and the layout is like millenial cafes in general with nature concept But if you are sunsetcatcher person or street view lovers youll love this This cafe is semioutdoor and theres a rooftop You can watch the birds the streets and the most exciting thing is you can watch the passing train This cafe will be my goto when I feel stress and overwhelm the ambience can calm my mind
I also love the food the price is reasonable but yummy I like the potato wedges so cooked and crunchy The lychee tea is also fresh nottoo sweet and not artificial

Price 55
Ambience 55
Food 55 Potato wedges Rp1200000
Drinks 55 Ice lychee tea Rp12000 Hot red velvet Rp12000

the place are very nice quite cozy if you guys can stand the trains but the serving almost 45mins apparently for the way they responded when i asked about my order they forgot about it and the waiter didnt say a word or apologise the iced coffee taste like water and didnt have the consistentcy to be called a coffee

just a normal coffee shop with train view",0.8999999999999999,0.0125629595322179,0.6337688878596652,2837,"hitams ambience, coffee shop, look trains, trains serving, millenial cafes, trains view, cafe semioutdoor, kopi baja, train view, cafe goto"

Always trust your guts when it tells you not to visit some place Once I ignored and I got this unpleasant experience Place a bit fancy but not with their food and beverages Coffees no good at all and I got undercooked rice on my meal and they took forever to served it I didnt bother to complain because I was too exhausted Definitely will not coming back

New coffeeshop in town I tried Cappuccino Royal double shots capp with 20k for the price and I would give 7810 for the taste The location was so strategic and kind of hectic to find a parking place but not that hard They have many menus with affordable price and snacks Also has 2 floors and their good services would made me to come back later

Not bad there were a lot of food and beverage options and they tasted quite decent for such a little place Interior is excellent however the only downside is the small parking area which can be pretty dangerous since it is close to the busy main road

Nice

cheapest yet the most creamy coffee that i ever tasted

One of the coffeeshops in Malang The location is very strategic close to campus located on Jalan Raya Manunggal Sudimoro Malang City

This place comes with an interesting concept The place is also very spacious Inside and to the side there are also flowers The place is fun and very comfortable There are indoor and outdoor areas which are both spacious and comfortable Also there is an area above the 2nd floor which is very spacious

The menu at this Coffeeshop varies both coffee and noncoffee and the prices are pocketfriendly Good service So for that friends who want to drink coffee or hang out with friends This place can be an option if you are in Malang

I like the coffee chill if Im not mistaken 910
Cookies 910 because its fat and has chocolate filling in it
Churros with Tiramisu Sauce 910
And my friends cold drink I dont know how it tastes because I cant drink cold anymore
Instagrammable friends
You can park the car in front of it or go a little further on the right side of the road under a tree if you want its better

The place is comfortable to relax
The coffee taste is standard cafe You see not all the coffee in turen is good The food is also not bad

but the caffe latte was good
the facility is nice
It has mushalla as well
I love that the toilet has a mirror on the inside so I can touch my face up

The price is a little bit expensive for students but its paid off with their nice ambience Menu wise their ice choco mint is the bomb best of the best 5star from me but for their fruity punch is too sweet Plus point for this cafe is the toilets provide sanitary pads for women what a good consideration

The place has a nice ambient and friendly barista The price is just a little bit over the bar compare to other location in the area The food and beverage is good but not great just another typical coffeeshop foodies But if you want a nice place to do work or just chill with homies this place is a great choice

The Best 

Previously selling Tahwa angsle and rounds around on a bicycle now they have a shop

Hot ginger menus such as takwa soy porridge drenched in ginger water and ronde ginger nuts have been my mainstays for a long time

The menu offered by the tavern is currently quite varied there are gingerbased menus such as ronde and takwa as well as angsle and several other menus In my opinion the price is very affordable to save your body and soul that is cold in the city wind

at first glance the shop is sometimes not visible because the place where the shop rises up and is covered by a tree in front of the house

Including the one thats pretty good With kick ginger later

The prices are cheap but not cheap and the food is delicious all of them are really suitable for now when its the rainy season heheh",0.8999999999999999,0.0039367799455798,0.6311810339836739,2997,"place shop, ginger nuts, menus opinion, cozy best, ginger water, offered tavern, tavern currently, varied gingerbased, angsle menus, menus takwa"

matcha frappe less sugar 35

far from expectations plus after drinking my throat immediately coughed coughing wow it didnt fit on my tongue even though Im a matcha lover huf sad The service is also a bit long maybe one more barista should be added if the order is busy okay

it should be ready when its ready please slide it so the driver knows if the order is ready please dont let the driver get sprayed by the customer because he ordered a hot drink for a long time there was no notification and it hasnt been taken for a long time its cold Please pay attention

Nice vibes

Found this warkop by accident when passing through Cor Jesu It turns out to be a humble and nice place to chat There are several types of drinks and the prices are still affordable Plus on weekends you can have morning coffee here interesting

If by chance its late and you are looking for a place to drink coffee or tea you can come here especially after the rain it is suitable to cover and drink warm drinks here

For the drinks themselves there is coffee and quite a wide selection of teas I personally think the selection of teas is quite unique and worth trying all of them I tried the milk tea myself and its quite suitable for the taste maybe next time Ill ask for the level of sweetness to be reduced Then had time to try the lemon grass eggplant Unique warm and fresh thats the description Perfect for accompanying the evenings after the rain

For food there are some snacks that can accompany your cup of coffee or tea please check whats available

As for the seats themselves on the side of the road around this warkop area there are quite a lot of chairs so dont worry about not getting a place Likewise the parking area is also wide and guarded by parking officers safe

The coffeeshop itself is only a building for the bar area And in my opinion the arrangement is really neat starting from the decoration with retro items then the arrangement of the tea jars and tools is neat its nice to see It also makes you feel at home looking at the bar and then seeing the crowd around Accompanied by the sound of the street The point is serene

Overall a fun place always happy to stop by a place like this Immediately put it on the list of warkop that are worth going to

The coffee menu is complete The place is unique aesthetic For food the taste is worth the cheap price and the portions are filling The people are friendly Recommended for a place to do assignments nonformal meetings or dating

The place is okay comfortable suitable for young people to hang out A variety of menus are served starting from a fried rice menu egg salad to drinks such as tubruk kobi and matcha latte in the cafe

Finally I can taste Lampung Robusta Coffee and Lintong Arabica its boring the problem is that Ijen always closes everywhere

Nice cafe the coffee menu is pretty good at affordable prices You can also buy coffee beans if you want to grind yourself at home Like the lemon tea If you are hungry while hanging out here they also provide heavy menus such as crispy chicken steak fresh vegetables and fried rice Price Affordable for students I ordered a crispy chicken steak for only 16 thousand and got a more filling portion than the usual steak stalls The chicken fried rice is also not bad with 15 thousand you can already get Portugal diggers portion plus eggs and crackers but the chicken steak is really a winner The employees are very friendly Next time will come here again",0.8999999999999999,0.0016789208591443,0.6305036762577432,3095,"menus crispy, menu pretty, aesthetic food, good affordable, rice menu, recommended place, coffee lintong, cafe finally, robusta coffee, buy coffee"

For fun I asked the barista who happened to be the owner himself  he said this coffee is originally from Aceh So for coffee lovers you should know how different it is

I came here at night but wanted to try here in the morning The problem is that there is birds nest rolled which my friend said is also good for catching huhu

Apart from serving good coffee according to personal opinion the hospitality and serenity at this place have become one of the escape and hidden gems among shops in Rajekwesi Wilis Malang City

 specialty in Taiwan dessert
 MUST TRY THEIR BINGSOO Any flavor it is soooo perfect
 I like the concept
 strategic location
 indoor and outdoor available
 MUST TRY APPLE CRUMBLE PUDDING
 their snacks also delicious 
 my favorite dessert bar in Town
 small place
 toilet is too small
 limited parking spot
 no big signage in front so you need to look carefully

Best bingsoo ive ever tasted My favorite one will always be their strawberry cheesecake bingsoo Cost around 40k rupiah to get this bowl of sweetness which can be eaten by 12 person Make sure to pick the right time to come here because usually theyre full and theres a waiting list especially on the weekend

Super ecstatic to have an authentic bingsoo place in Malang I mean the bingsoo that usually being sold in my hometown usually the cheap version But Timtong elevated it close to the actual bingsoo supposed to be

It was delicious the ice shaved is so soft and creamy because it was made from creamy milk and processed using the real bingsoo machine The red bean on my Azuki Matcha is also royal I mean they gave me lots of it so it is guaranteed youre gonna be satisfied to have one bowl of shared bingsoo here

The single serving is actually for 2 portion and the sharing serving can be enjoyed by 34 person The price is affordable Place is comfy but too small and often had long queue The sweetener is using honey Anyway they also sell refreshing drinks and tea which are also hard to miss

I will definitely go back here and recommend this place despite its wellknown association with the Masterchef winner

Beware of the queue as it gets so long on weekend Pricewise is cheap as the portion is big The main dish served at 0900 but it opens at 0700 so if you come before 0900 you have to wait for the dish to be served Really love the rice pot because i think it only sold here The kungpao is dominant with sweet taste but really great I recommend you all to order the milo tarik cause its super great 

nice ambicence like singaporean kopitiam in 80s

Good coffee and teh tarik

Must try the claypot rice savory and tasty
and kaya toast the sweetness is just right

Beware of the crowds every weekend morning

I dont usually give 3 stars rating but i hope this served as a feedback to improve Was honestly liking the whole ambience of old chinatown neighborhood because it just felt so nice  very down to earth What gives me not so pleasant is it took too long to serve when theres no queue Ordered butter coffee  somehow its fine just not really my liking Also ordered kungpao chicken which tastes okay which for me i think you could do better to make it taste more like kungpao chicken and the last is mie kwa which I dont really fond of It just tastes wrong The noodles are okay its ordinary but the soup is just  Im losing the concept of the taste because its herby with the wrong kind of bitter taste in it I hope you could improve the taste somehow and take this feedback because the place has a good potential 

The ambience is like tempo doeloe
It is really crowded in the weekend you should come on the weekdays if you dont like to queue

Good for group easy to find affordable price Their coffe tasted good

I was interested to visit this place for I saw plenty parking customers motorcycles by the fence every time I pass it Unfortunately what I got on visit was opposite to inviting

Arriving at this place this place was pretty empty It was around 2 in the afternoon The room design was simpleit is more like dull square chairs and rectangular brown tables Definitely nothing about its atmosphere attracts people to come The street at its front was noisy and it is a huge oven with metal roof ready to bake anyone Probably it is so since there is no tree around it

The coffee was actually fine yet it does nothing to reduce the inconveniences The perfect disaster brought by its french fries It was served on a plate of 20 cm of diameter and looked slightly wet When I touched it was really damp seemed like soaked in cooking oil rather fried And thanks to the fries bland taste my disappointment was complete

I still do not understand the reason people coming back to this place

Refreshing real strawberry milk amidst a storm of highsugar flavors Love it

It is a cozy place to chill outdoor seating power outlet you can get some work done here But it is somewhat hot in the afternoon

The food is nice and the drink is pretty good Be mindful that traffic noise may be a little loud

a spacious place to grab some snack and afternoon tea cakes are various includes traditional ones taste are worth the price should be live music show if it werent for this cov19 situation not much option for main course but then again it is a cake store

the staff were great they were so humble to customers but sadly the services take too long  i almost wait for 2 hours just to enjoy my own food but its ok they already said sorry to us and even give us a complimentary food

taste overall so gewd i ordered Chicken Salted Egg it tasted like a literal salted egg that i found at chinese restaurant For an advice maybe you guys should give us as a customer an option of spiciness For the drink i ordered Kopi Susu Jaya it taste so creamy but the coffee is lacking I still kinda liked it btw hehe

thats it goodluck

was here when they just opened the store and comin back here when the store is wider with a collab to Dua Legenda the coffee is a real mantap jaya the cashier is so polite and helpful a great experience will come back for sure

The coffee shop decoration is like in the 40s but yeah nothings really cool in the other hand the coffee is quite good

Its a good place for hangout with friends the foodies and beverages are delicious and especially the manual brewed coffee I loved it but its not recommend for people who find serenity

my first impression was the menu is really variative with affordable price range the croissant is also really good crispy yet buttery definitely must try i really like the iced coffee latte i also ordered caesar salad which surprisingly came in big portion definitely will come back to try other menu

I remembered that this bakery was succesfully made a good impression to me especially for their ciabatta bread but i think recently their quality is not as good as before Its still enjoyable but i have to say that they could be better
If you have time go dine in or takeaway is cheaper than order via grabgojek since they will upcharge price up to 20

Spacious place comfy for group working or individual Breads  rice noodles and various beverages are there for accompanying ur work

Nice place to have a small meet up with your friends strategic location delicious snack and good STMJ which literally means drink made of Milk Egg Honey and Ginger And remember if you intend to come on Saturday night this place will be a little bit overcrowded

My first time going there
I went there around 10pm and it was so crowded
Tbh it was so cold so if you cant bear the coldness prepare your jacket since its Malangs night
This was the first stmj i drink in malang
Oh STMJ means Susu Telur Madu Jahe Milk with egg honey and ginger
I ordered regular STMJ and my friend ordered chocolate SMJ Milk with honey and ginger also some tofu and toast
It was so crowded and it was Saturday that we wait the drink for 40 minutes
Bcs it was my first time there idk wether that was categorized as long time or not
But we waited the drink and food for long time  in my opinion 
The stmj was good I didnt feel the raw egg
And the tofu was smooth The toast also good
Overall all fine except the time we used for waiting But its okay

Good prices With street place A lot of variant of food Good portion of the food But maybe little bit not comfort if you sit out

Simple place Nice local food",0.8500000000000001,0.0709199328431656,0.6162759798529497,3404,"oh stmj, snacks youll, raw egg, opinion stmj, ginger ordered, drink food, egg honey, location delicious, local food, served stmj"

Actually its gonna be a late review cause ive been here for like a month ago Ok next so from my opinion is Sudut Coffee is just like others coffee shop startup like a plain concrete chair small rock in the floor you know what it is But it is not a bad thing nor a good things For the coffee its the same thing but here they serve their signature jamaican something i kind a forget and i belive its mixed with some rum but correct me if im wrong The last things is the cookies which is good i like it Overall its okay for me

Good place and cozy the baverages taste good but nothing special the price is standard

We came here two times while staying in Malang The menu is very diverse lots to choose starting from western dishes finishing with some with indonesian twist Fresh and healthy food Portions are not too big so just order loads and try everything like we did Probably the only vegan place in Malang lovely atmosphere and amazing smiling staff We also bought two packs of their homemade cookies to snack on the train Defo recommend

Food is good but the service time is terrible I ordered pasta and green soup waiting 1 hour 12 minutes

Good decent gym with nice pool The staff are very friendly and accommodating Overall good experience

Ordered from Gofood the price doesnt reflect the taste and the food quality because i got a very delicious pasta and burritos for a very reasonable price i went to an Italian restaurant in malang before they have an Italian chef so the price is kinda little bit more expensive but i could compare the taste tbh so definitely worthy although i hope they can improve the burritos a little bit because theres too much sauce and i prefer them to be fresh with less or no sauce",0.875,0.01111561396399,0.615834684189197,3423,"ordered pasta, western dishes, food level, healthy food, vegan place, vegan food, restaurant malang, improve burritos, burritos reasonable, italian restaurant"

The place is hidden in a small road and unexpected  I found it by chance but it was actually a nice surprise I like the setting especially the veranda outside A free setting makes the place look bigger and relaxing atmosphere is obvious here
The drinks are good and the sushi is ok
Lots of parking place for motorcycles but the cars have  to park on the side road next to it Worth a try 

Affordable good food with big portions better sit outside under the shade because the indoor building is too hot even if all aircons were turned on The service from the waiterwaitress was good but not for the cashier The cashier lady was unfriendly and not very welcoming towards me  my friends she handled our order lazily like she didnt want to be there

Love the ambiance Its located in a quiet neighbourhood Vast parking area Very bright the place will put you in a good mood once your glance at it Really love the outdoor area Best time to come here I think is around 35pm Coupled with Malang fresh air Definitely a place for a fun gathering with friends Food was alright We ordered School Dosirak and Jjajangmyeon with Itaewon ReVe drink and Hongdae milk w salted caramel Itaewon drink could be better Hongdae was tasty The staffs were very friendly and helpful

Love the atmosphere here For those who want to feel the Korean vibe and who like KPop its really suitable here The parking lot is quite wide and next to Sejenak Coffee
The interior design looks simple from the outside as soon as you enter you immediately feel the Korean vibes because of the Korean decorations and music being played Aesthetic in every corner
There are quite a lot of indoor and outdoor places In the indoor area there is a really good photobox In the outdoor area there is a pojangmacha selling street food
The menu options vary from snacks to heavy meals There is a grill package menu ramyeon and other menus such as mandu kimbab and many more For drinks there are quite a few choices There is also a showcase filled with bottled and canned drinks Prices range is 23 thousand  55 thousand rupiahs Suitable for lunch or dinner Or hanging out snacking and enjoying the vibes is also okay If youre expecting food in kdrama youll find it here

The place is hidden in a small road and unexpected  I found it by chance but it was actually a nice surprise I like the setting especially the veranda outside A free setting makes the place look bigger and relaxing atmosphere is obvious here
The drinks are good and the sushi is ok
Lots of parking place for motorcycles but the cars have  to park on the side road next to it Worth a try 

Affordable good food with big portions better sit outside under the shade because the indoor building is too hot even if all aircons were turned on The service from the waiterwaitress was good but not for the cashier The cashier lady was unfriendly and not very welcoming towards me  my friends she handled our order lazily like she didnt want to be there

Love the ambiance Its located in a quiet neighbourhood Vast parking area Very bright the place will put you in a good mood once your glance at it Really love the outdoor area Best time to come here I think is around 35pm Coupled with Malang fresh air Definitely a place for a fun gathering with friends Food was alright We ordered School Dosirak and Jjajangmyeon with Itaewon ReVe drink and Hongdae milk w salted caramel Itaewon drink could be better Hongdae was tasty The staffs were very friendly and helpful

Love the atmosphere here For those who want to feel the Korean vibe and who like KPop its really suitable here The parking lot is quite wide and next to Sejenak Coffee
The interior design looks simple from the outside as soon as you enter you immediately feel the Korean vibes because of the Korean decorations and music being played Aesthetic in every corner
There are quite a lot of indoor and outdoor places In the indoor area there is a really good photobox In the outdoor area there is a pojangmacha selling street food
The menu options vary from snacks to heavy meals There is a grill package menu ramyeon and other menus such as mandu kimbab and many more For drinks there are quite a few choices There is also a showcase filled with bottled and canned drinks Prices range is 23 thousand  55 thousand rupiahs Suitable for lunch or dinner Or hanging out snacking and enjoying the vibes is also okay If youre expecting food in kdrama youll find it here

Overall its a good place and good eats",0.825,0.127076940890407,0.615623082267122,3443,"sit outside, suitable lunch, smoke grill, definitely place, food affordable, shade indoor, area best, suitable parking, grill activity, place fun"

Recommend for whom craving for Roti bakar with many flavours and yummy toppings

Really nice place to get relax here good foods taste friendly prices for metry it you wont regret it

the place is decent the employees are many the food is also not bad the drinks that I ordered are also okay

there was a message
fried noodles boiled noodles rainbow toast cheese toast roasted corn taro pure milk ice chocolate milkshake ginger wedang chocolate ice warm orange

I think the taro milk doesnt taste like the milk but it takes a long time to taste the taro thats it the chocolate milkshake is okay then the rainbow toast color is like that  at first you can see it on tiktok the color is really pretty but its worth it the price is good but for those who like a lot of stuffing its perfect if you like standard itll be bad because theres a lot of stuffing but the grilled corn is also delicious its been printed one by one so its easier to eat the onion rings are not bad either

the service is okay friendly and good too maybe because its a bit crowded okay for student pockets its also worth it but because its a family here its okay its safe and the location is next to the main road so its easy to find thats okay  thankyou success continues and maintain the service and taste

Roti Bakar Om Doel in Sawojajar Malang is a place to eat that is worth a try for toast lovers The price offered is very affordable so you dont need to worry about spending a lot of money The taste of the toast here is very delicious and satisfying especially with the variety of toppings that you can choose according to your taste

This dining area is also quite spacious and has a comfortable atmosphere so it is perfect for enjoying toast with family or friends Unfortunately the service here is rather slow and unsatisfactory However this does not reduce the quality and taste of the toast offered

In general Roti Bakar Om Doel is a place to eat that is worth a try for toast lovers with affordable prices and delicious taste However there are still a number of things that need to be improved such as rather long service",0.875,0.0082209228275343,0.6149662768482602,3469,"service taste, yummy toppings, chicken bangladesh, place eat, taste toast, corn delicious, lots dish, taste roti, prices delicious, bakar flavours"

Vapestore top 

Good

Good place

It was the first time I went to a vape store in Malang and my expression was WOW WOW WOW Why According to me

1 The location factor its very comfortable here the room is airconditioned the atmosphere is relaxed the arrangement of the place is minimalist and neat so that it is eyecatching with the products being sold but there are still minuses starting from the lack of seats so that it is less supportive for a place to hang out and share knowledge after buying a product or just sharing with the owner

2 Service factor TOP MARKOTOP the owner is super friendly to me who is illiterate in vaping he still gives knowledge in a fun and easy to understand way so I understand and am satisfied with the questions I asked the store owner he too Patiently answering my questions even though I actually understand a little

3 Product factors and product prices in this case I am still okay with the products being sold and offered to me because the prices and products here are almost all vape stores selling what this shop sells I havent found any rare products being sold here or maybe I dont know which products are rare or not

Conclusion
I give this shop a score of 95 out of 100 because its not from the location and product factors but from the friendly and friendly service I feel like Im talking to my own friends

Suggestions and critics
To store owners
Please extend your stores opening hours so that customers who dont have time in the morning or afternoon can visit your store at any time
Please add seats for customers so they can linger the goal is to feel comfortable and be able to share knowledge with fellow vape users and with you as a shop owner
If you have added a hanging out facility dont forget to make it complete provide soft drinks for your customers to buy so that it will be more comfortable and crowded with customers

Thats all from me thank you for your service

Nice

I think this cafe is out of the box
Other times whats the chicken or the meat
But what is raised is seafood like fish and so on
In terms of cafe design its the same as usual
But the food is really good
The taste is unique and the sauce is the same as the grilled fish
Over all I like it
At first I didnt like it and didnt really like to eat fish
Even though the pantura people
After eating there the mainset was pretty much eroded eaa
It turns out that fish is no less delicious than chicken if you make it geprek
Same with nampool already
Lets just try it not until 2200 yaa

Looking for a date place while eating cheaply Yes at Iwak Cafe This place is really recommended and definitely very instagramable Apart from being a very strategic place namely on Jl Kedungombo Dam No 7 Malang is near the ITN campus and is indeed a culinary location for Ngalam students this place is also comfortable not too crowded Very suitable for a date with a partner

Its located in klayatan gg II close to the Kampoeng shop The place is small comfortable and beautiful But if you come here before eating make sure the table is dust free because the few times Ive been here the table is definitely dusty so I clean it with a tissue first
For a lot of empty menus there are always noodles There are many noodle variants that you can choose the topping for
I recommend Cwie Mie with gizzard liver topping because it tastes great
For the drink I recommend the fresh and delicious iced sunrise
There is also free wifi here but sometimes its slow besides that sometimes you can smell the garbage which is about 4 houses from the shop

Recommended

Suitable for family hangouts because you dont have to go far to town The location is convenient but when its busy the service is a bit long because there are only a few employees and there is no music as entertainment There is a prayer room and clean bathrooms The menu is diverse Prices start at IDR 5000 for drinks and for food prices start at IDR 10000
It seems there is no wifi To taste like a cafe

Recommended to visit when passing or in Malang City Sukun Village Area

Not only delicious and comfortable for young people but also for mothers both for social gatherings or friendship among friends a comfortable place for gentlemen to drink coffee in the afternoon or at night

Serving various drinks  food and the prices are overall affordable

The place is spacious good for hanging out in the afternoon or evening But hot days are not good
The menu consists of noodles For food taste 610
What is lacking here is cleanliness For food it looks open even though it is arranged around the stove So this is like an ingredient that is about to be cooked and is surrounded by flies Hopefully in the future please pay attention to cleanliness Because what goes into the stomach is important Also please store the vegetables properly Because when I eat vegetables it looks bad",0.875,0.0037052046546633,0.6136115613963989,3547,"vegetables properly, consists noodles, good menu, place spacious, affordable place, recommended visit, sukun village, food prices, drinks food, cleanliness food"

It is a nice and homelike coffee shop with very friendly crews The foods are great the beverages are delightful too

great heritage architecture

The ambiance at Golden Sand is comfortable warm and calm Interior design is also suitable to be combined with buildings that are indeed Dutch heritage

For food the portions and prices are standard and reasonable As for the taste its also delicious theres nothing to complain about

Waiter service is also very friendly and smiling Big applause for the waiter and the barista

My only complaint might be the different prices between the menu and those on the bill for some foods the price can go up 1025k from what is on the menu book For drinks it can actually be 25k cheaper than the menu book Maybe the menu book can be updated so that customers can be more comfortable

Overall still a great place great food and great ambiance Will I come back here Of course The comfortable atmosphere succeeds in making me want to come back to taste other dishes But for now 4 stars first if there is improvement in the future 5 stars for sure

After trying to migrate from foreign products now Im starting to explore local products created by close relatives
One of them is like SKUNK PIZZA imagine that with only 25k you can get your dream pizza with requested toppings and mozzarella cheese
The location is Singosari it just so happens that my friends who are in the Malang area can come closer to Singosari For those of you who are in Singosari you can order an online motorcycle taxi
Enjoy your food todayyy 

I really like eating pizza a la chef dhevanata
The bread is really soft and the toppings are also freshguaranteed you will be addictedlove it anyway

Enough for the first 3 You have to learn to better understand the situation and the difference between the customer and the driver who bought it Drivers need faster time when taking gfood orders Fresh its ok But more experience will be more than the other It means Learn from previous experience to be more fast and furious Differentiate between drivers and regular customers

When I ask why the price is different The cashier just replied I dont know Miss in the application this is it with an unfriendly tone to answer it
Well I just paid then even though it felt uncomfortable with his attitude

Cozy Monochrome and Affordable

The concept raised is monochrome simple black and white

Before entering there is a sweetener on Dans right and left wall designs that you can use to take picturesselfies etc In the form of flowers with a choice of beautiful colors

The facilities provided are also quite complete Free Wifi AC room toilet prayer room and a representative parking lot as well as power plugs Indoor and outdoor table options are also available Whether you come with work friends or just the two of you with your loved ones everything is facilitated at Dans Kitchen

The menu choices are very modern and friendly to students which is the main target of Dans kitchen Heavy meals snacks soups and drinks are also quite diverse

There is always something that can be improved at this hangout location you can add a choice of delivery providers such as gojek grab etc and a pointer to a restaurant on the side of the road

What a great experience of eating Durian The price was also reasonable and the view was ok Its giving the new experience to eat Durian and see the Durian trees around meaning that the Durian is as fresh as we can get

But the only to improve was on the kpop music that kept played that was the atmosphere breaker

Its located on the hills so i call this place is embarassing place to take a relax because the sightseeing was beautiful while you get lunch with various recipe javanese traditional recipe with a delicious taste or you can choose from fried rice or fried noodle or lalapan and there are many kind of coffe that you can select and of course there are many durian trees you can choose taste pay and enjoy it with your family or your collegues also you can take away both of the food or durian it has big parking area and it has many gazebo you also can do reservation first so try it

Nice place to enjoy sightseeing and be refreshed Durian trees are everywhere Can buy durian and Indinesian food and drinks with reasonable price We can choose what to eat from many variaties of durian Monthong or local both are delicious There will be a live music available after the stage is ready under construction About 30 minutes from Malang Well must drive carefully because relatively small streets to reach there but smooth Recommended place for durian lovers

This coffee shop is so wellknown arround the students in Malang because this places included as the most productive coffee shops for discussion and another agendas Its also commonly called as Gusdurian a group of people who follow the value of Gus Dur 4th President of Indonesia basecamp and also the place for meeting and discussion by another communities tho There are many books in the first floor and its actually has 3 floors This place is not only sold the coffee but also tea milk hot chocolate and so on

this place live up to its name it provides light drinks coffee and small snacks theres a decent public library means you dont need to worry if you forgot to bring your books wifi are also available if youre in for some productivity tasks parking is not shaded and its on the side of the street directly may not suitable for dating but best for group discussion

EDIT several days ago I went back and found out if you want to do events here you need to secure mininum purchase of several hundred thousand rupiahs If you cannot do that they charge you additional money But not all the menus are available for us to purchase Most of them are sold out but they dont care if we couldnt reach the mark we still need to pay the money How could we fulfill their minimum purchase if we cannot order anything I lowered my points from 4 to 2 Still a good place but not recommended for meeting

I went here for a casual meeting with my friend They ran out of the snack and meals I could ordered iced taro only The price was cheap I was surprised the photo in the Google maps didnt match the reality The place was kinda dirty They might havent mopped the floor for a really long time There were thick layer of dust above the books on the shelf I was having my drink in the rooftop The rooftop was dirty and kinda dark There were only one or two light bulbs The toilet was in the second story it was really smelly and disgusting Poorly maintained place

I was hosting a discussion event inviting some groups several days ago The management charges us 210k rupiah for minimum purchase

What really disappoint me is

Various choices of coffee preparation methods

When it comes to coffee I believe most would like to spent their time by sitting back and relax so in this place I see groups of friends gather and talk over coffee They laugh drink sing and then go home Unfortunately seat with backrest is none to see here
The coffee is admittedly somewhat nice The milk is fresh and goes side by side with the coffee is a regular cup It would be a star when it is served in a bottle with a brand in a fridge of a convenient store The sugar was plenty to keep the older away Yet the temperature is inviting for the white collars to slow down after work
In conclusion this place could have been better

This is the first time a coffee employee has memories like this Usually its just fine friendly and enjoy uh this is a guy but his mouth is like a girls just scowling when someone is talking

If you still maintain employees like that I can report to the CONSUMER PROTECTION FOUNDATION for the unpleasant behavior of the employees

I hope that the big name KOPI KENANGAN is supported by employees who have good ethics

Here the coffee tastes different from other memorable coffees the body is too bold too strong seems to use a different blend of coffee like using robusta coffee or maybe it was just a one time accident when I ordered it in the morning via ojol

Try it for the first time and order via grabfood This time the order is iced coffee from memories of the former  iced chocolate runaway The iced coffee from this former memory tastes okay for me who doesnt really like coffee taste 810 But for the big no ice chocolate the taste is far from expectations Compared to pure cocoa it has chtime so much taste Taste 710

The coffee is pretty good The price is also comfortable in the 18k pocket for a latte

It can be chocolate granules fruit jelly colorful candies and chocolate milk which makes the ice cream just unique
This ice cream doesnt taste much different from the ice cream we usually eat
Its just that its made in a very unique and funny way sometimes its a shame to eat it
This ice was very popular at the time its just normal now
In Malang its in the food court Malang Town Square or commonly called MATOS
But the 1st floor is near the stairs
More or less priced at 1015 thousand per portion Im very satisfied with choosing my favorite topping 1 topping 1 top layer yes

For those who dont know and want to know
Whats an ice pot
The ice pot is marni colored ice cream placed in a small pot which also has various colors and is decorated with toppings according to your wishes
It can be chocolate granules fruit jelly colorful candies and chocolate milk which makes the ice cream just unique
This ice cream doesnt taste much different from the ice cream we usually eat
Its just that its made in a very unique and funny way sometimes its a shame to eat it
This ice was very popular at the time its just normal now
In Malang its in the food court Malang Town Square or commonly called MATOS
But the 1st floor is near the stairs
More or less priced at 1015 thousand per portion Im very satisfied with choosing my favorite topping 1 topping 1 top layer yes
If its more than that you usually pay more

Not bad Unfortunately when I bought it Ms forgot to give the worms Maybe because the first buyer

It Crimea

I love the vanilla mint tea for drink and tahu telor pedas for food I dont recommend the dim sums though

The one star off is because sometime there is loud low quality music played in background

its just a small good coffe shop with hospitality touch at the corner of center Sukarno Hatta road where youth people spending their time or gathering I think it a nice place for chatting

coffee shop with a view of the train tracks in my opinion the price is relatively expensive when compared to the taste served

The taste was okay But i dont think its worth the price cause the portion was small
They have indoor and outdoor setting But the indoor was to dark and gloomy The only good thing was the outdoor cause you can see the train but you will absolutely cant use it if it were raining outside
They played the music out loud to the point of annoying I spend time to work there and have a meeting But they didnt even bother to decrease the volume
And dont forget the music wasnt suite the cafe vibes
And also lots of mosquito if you stay there past 5pm

Hopefully the review helps other visitors and also the cafe so they can improve again
Of all the steak menus there is only smoked brisket steak
Then there are only snacks grilled sausages and french fries

The boba drink is delicious but the seal on the lid is not strong so one house is broken 

it really tastes like this is the best boba anyway the price is not expensive but super delicious the best one is the original brown sugar Ive tried other flavors but its not great this is already delicious the cheese is ok the sweetness is just right instead of buying another brand which is already expensive 20 thousand and above its not worth it its better to just buy this

40 thousand buy 2 get 1 free cheap the boba is delicious its just that the packaging pays more attention because the order via Gofood spilled a bit 2 cups the original free one is also no less delicious than the taro boba the sweetness doesnt disappear even I just want to finish it its a shame coz the milk tastes fresh and delicious

Recommended 

I ordered black tofu and lukumades donut and both tasted beyond my expectations I really like the donut goes well with dark chocolate sauce and speculoos lotus I dont really like the sambal on top of the black tofu especially the celery smells too strong But the cooking time I think is too long I waited for about 45 minutes for my foods

Delicious food and friendly service cozy place especially the souffl is very tasty and soft

The variety of drinks and food that I ordered was unique in taste and texture Everything is delicious and the creme cheese isnt sour

Im just a little disappointed with the cashiers I want to order plain iced tea they say I cant because the sugar has already been mixed into the tea Finally ordered iced sweet tea Er the iced tea arrived and at the bottom of the glass there was sugar that had not been stirred Yes sis that means I can order plain without sugar  You can serve it in a friendly way too sis

Angkringan which is always crowded with young people hanging out

As for location pretty good according to the theme which is a place to hang out  some are sitting on the floor and some are sitting at table chairs Yesterday when I was here it suddenly rained soo a bit wet because the sandals also dripped water from the roof Supported by ambyar songs its getting better

For food its delicious Its just that yesterday when I ordered it wasnt very dry So theres no burnt appearance the impression is that its just warmed up for a while and also if you dont ask for seasoning dont add more seasoning Finally I asked the waitress to burn it until it was a little burnt Plus asking for spices So that the food tastes better

The best food here is SATE SKIN which is really the winner hehehee

Continue to be successful

Its been a long wait Ive been waiting for 1 hour the order hasnt arrived yet from 2126 to 2234 until we finally come to the place of order and it turns out that the order has not yet been processed it is still in the bottom pile before being processed finally waiting 15 more minutes for orders to be taken wrapped taken home no longer eaten on the spot
For the food that is being sold please check because the Fish Oskab Etas I ordered it tasted sourstale
BECAUSE ITS ALREADY 1 HOUR 15 MINUTES WAITING
ENOUGH ONCE THERE AND NOT WORTH TO TRY AGAIN

food and drink took long to come he said the note was lost even though the food hasnt been delivered how come it can get lost when people who just came come first while those who have been coming since earlier havent come for almost an hour and havent come when the cashier was asked the answer was not clear bitchy and when spoken to he did not respond properly please repair the service again Ive also been asked not to use spices given spicy seasoning

Not bad for being a place to kill time while waiting for a movie to be watched at Moviemax Sarinah You can get a ticket to watch at night because  For seats on the outside smoking area you can get a view of the Malang city square and Ramayana 

Its my first time here Im quite disappointed Ordered crispy chicken tofu tempeh ginger and genbira soda half an hour of waiting was not finished It was great because there was a viewing schedule and the result was 30 minutes late watching total waiting for food to be cooked for 45 minutes maybe more Even drinking takes a long time not given at the beginning brg eat it Sorry for an honest review  Maybe the cooking staff is lacking or the ingredients have run out so they are forced the problem is when we ordered they also asked if the stock was still available or not 
About the standard taste because the price is quite cheap the size of a mall I hope it can be better and more crowded 

Clean not crowded comfortable can be indoor or outdoor so those who need a smoking area can really do it those who dont want to can also hang out comfortably inside
You can drink coffee eat snack or something else too if you want while you dont want to watch you can do that too

Had wanted to try the batagor but suddenly it wasnt comfortable with the t4 the service was jutek  perfunctory not clean there wasnt a restroomkm Still better at the food court next door cleaner  friendly service  more menu choices

Im really sorry Make a culinary business a little bit more serious

really good the batagor is super 
dumplings are delicious too
good service friendly  fast
can be ordered through ojol too
can ask for the spices to be separated
