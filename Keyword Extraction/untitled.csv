Cafe Sawah Pujonkidul,ChIJc357HEEp1i0R6hhXCd3R2ts,"Kawasan Cafe Sawah, Desa Wisata, Krajan, Pujon Kidul, Kec. Pujon, Kabupaten Malang, Jawa Timur 65391, Indonesia","tourist_attraction, cafe, amusement_park, park, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment",4.5,17274,1.0,"Cafe Sawah Pujon Kidul is one of the cafes located in the Pujon area. This cafe is close to residential areas. Here there are various kinds of food and drinks at low prices. In addition, in this cafe there are also rides for games for children, teenagers and adults. Beautiful scenery and cool weather make people who visit the cafe enjoy the atmosphere there more. The car park here is wide, but tourists who use buses must use a motorcycle taxi service to go to the location, because the parking lot is quite far from the location. Apart from that, there tourists can bring souvenirs such as vegetables, fruit, fresh milk and others because there is a market available for shopping.

Great atmosphere, this place for city folks who doesn't connect to the nature on everyday life. Good place for eating some snacks and talks. They have guide to show the place around. This cafe managed by locals. The access to this is through the locals street so be careful when you go there cause there's kids on the road that play around. They have Guest house on this cafe.
The only downside here is that they play music from the speaker. For people like me who works in the city pak enjoying the silence of nature is better than some bad sound from speaker.

it such wonderful and peaceful place for you having holiday with family and friends. we can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the farming field and having snacks in the middle of farm. we can also buy directly from the farm of vegetables that are harvested ü•∞

Overall the cafe sawah itself is ok. Nice view. Service could be improved for better.
Rather difficult to order and take long time to get the food we order. Taste is standard. Ambience is ok. They also have rooftop area. There are some spots to take a picture (perhaps this is its USP Unique selling proposition).

Price is affordable, eventhough some visitors say the price is expensive.
If you want to go here just for eating, you will be disappointed because it is located inside village tourism area so that to enter/reach the restaurant, you have to pay ticket in the locket (12,5K/person) and parking (10k for car).
Payment : cash in major.

Everything is good. Food is nice, Accessible, nice weather! Nice view. Came here in the evening, should been super nice in the afternoon. Definitely will revisit.

I stayed one night and spend the whole time around NK Cafe. The food was superb, the staff are friendly, the air was cool, great place to spend time with family. There is jacuzzi in the villa, the rooms are fully equipped with amenities. NK also offers variety of activities such as coffee roasting education, gardening and veggie picking which is also safe to directly to be eaten.
One thing I have to mention is safety-ness of the area during rain. Overall, I had great experience here, well done NK!

It will look nicer at evening time when the lights are up. Food taste is good but portion is small. Numerous choices of food. Chocolate beverages are mostly recommended. Pricing is ok. Moderate service. Wifi is available but not so good. Spacious parking space.

Nice place for family, average taste of foods, friendly staff but they need to give attention for food equipments (glass etc). As the place in Highland... Time to inhale fresh air here, enjoy their green garden and small farm

I like this place because the food and drink was delicious and cheaper than another restaurant, the scenery was great its a combination between nature and modern you can look at my photos here. I'm sorry i don't have the pic of food bcs i forget to take of the pic but this place was serving the food n drink very good. It's recommendedüëç
