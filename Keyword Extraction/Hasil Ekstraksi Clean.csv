Cafe Sawah Pujonkidul,ChIJc357HEEp1i0R6hhXCd3R2ts,"Kawasan Cafe Sawah, Desa Wisata, Krajan, Pujon Kidul, Kec. Pujon, Kabupaten Malang, Jawa Timur 65391, Indonesia","tourist_attraction, cafe, amusement_park, park, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment",4.5,17274,1.0,"Cafe Sawah Pujon Kidul is one of the cafes located in the Pujon area This cafe is close to residential areas Here there are various kinds of food and drinks at low prices In addition in this cafe there are also rides for games for children teenagers and adults Beautiful scenery and cool weather make people who visit the cafe enjoy the atmosphere there more The car park here is wide but tourists who use buses must use a motorcycle taxi service to go to the location because the parking lot is quite far from the location Apart from that there tourists can bring souvenirs such as vegetables fruit fresh milk and others because there is a market available for shopping

Great atmosphere this place for city folks who doesnt connect to the nature on everyday life Good place for eating some snacks and talks They have guide to show the place around This cafe managed by locals The access to this is through the locals street so be careful when you go there cause theres kids on the road that play around They have Guest house on this cafe
The only downside here is that they play music from the speaker For people like me who works in the city pak enjoying the silence of nature is better than some bad sound from speaker

it such wonderful and peaceful place for you having holiday with family and friends we can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the farming field and having snacks in the middle of farm we can also buy directly from the farm of vegetables that are harvested 

Overall the cafe sawah itself is ok Nice view Service could be improved for better
Rather difficult to order and take long time to get the food we order Taste is standard Ambience is ok They also have rooftop area There are some spots to take a picture perhaps this is its USP Unique selling proposition

Price is affordable eventhough some visitors say the price is expensive
If you want to go here just for eating you will be disappointed because it is located inside village tourism area so that to enterreach the restaurant you have to pay ticket in the locket 125Kperson and parking 10k for car
Payment  cash in major

After exploring many coffee shops I found one coffee shop which I think is really worth it for students like us to visit   Nakoa cafe Bondowoso is one of my favorite hangout cafes it seems I have visited this cafe countless times  The reason why Nakoa is my favorite cafe is that most of the people who come here are students doing their assignments so it makes the atmosphere of the cafe calm and not chaotic  The people at Nakoa also dont care about visitors so I think Nakoa is really good for me time  My favorite menu here is the matcha latte   Apart from the matcha latte the drinks here are also delicious  The price is also standard which is under 25000  Apart from selling drinks here they also sell some delicious food moreover the donuts are really delicious and cheap   For those of you who like to do assignments alone you can really try this Nakoa cafe

The place so comfy for works both indoor and outdoor the coffee is great too WiFi so fast the staff so friendly i have a good experience at Nakoa Cafe just need some improvement to make the toilet clean Overall is good ill come again to Nakoa Cafe Waiting for the new menu for filling my tummy

the beans used for manual brew is get from local area occasionally theyll have a guest beans from far away
the machine based coffee is somewhat lack in my personal opinion
if you want a random surprise just say so to the barista hes rather friendly for a new customer

Hands down one of the most comfortable coffeeshops in Malang Even though the location is not too close to the Soehat area it turns out that the trip there is worth it

First you see the building looks like a vintage house but overall it looks neat the combination with the furniture which is dominated by wood fits perfectly It feels cool and homey especially the area isnt too crowded so you can feel calm

Try ordering the Japanese brew and heavy food Make the coffee just right and make it proper following the baristas advice for the choice of beans and it turns out to be exactly according to taste There are many drink menu choices whether you want coffee or noncoffee

For food you can order curry rice this one is special I myself dont often order heavy food at coffeeshops in Malang but here it really is the food is delicious The curry is really good even though its not too thick but the taste itself is delicious Plus there is katsu which is big in size and rice which seems to be in the panfry again so it has a taste The food combination is really delicious guaranteed not to regret it And the portions are huge for the price For now its a favorite curry in Malang you can even find something unique in a coffee shop There are also several kinds of heavy food and all of them are interesting of course I will try the others on my next visit

The service is also very friendly and quite good can also provide an explanation regarding the food and drinks that we will order where a brief description is also given on the menu

The seating area consists of indoor semioutdoor and outdoor I myself sat in the semioutdoor patio area near the bar There are also plugs available so that it is suitable for working while drinking coffee and eating The smoking area is in the outdoor near the parking lot The seats themselves arent that many but considering the proportions to the build theyre just right

Additional facilities such as wifi are also available there are also toilets

Parking for cars is in front of the coffeeshop while motorbikes are in the side area enough to accommodate visitors

Overall its really nice to have coffee in a quite different area a quiet area Suitable for work while enjoying coffee Plus the food is delicious this is really a plus so you dont have to bother moving places to eat Make sure to include the list of coffeeshops that you will visit",975,28.946.911.364.557,6.833.684.073.409.360,1232,"baristas advice, delicious curry, coffee noncoffee, curry rice, want coffee, coffee plus, coffeeshops malang, coffeeshops visit, comfortable coffeeshops, japanese brew"

Nice place and coffee like home

A very cute charming cafe The vintage style is special here The table legs are made of old sewing machines and the wooden look makes everything very cozy The owners are a cute little Indonesian family who run the hostel and the cafe themselves Even the coffee beans are produced on their own farm We loved that the owners mingled with the visitors to chat with us Jon and his son are wonderfully humble people who made our stay in Malang unforgettable We will be back again

The nuances of Europe especially the Netherlands are immediately felt as soon as you enter a cafe called Huize Jon Coffe This cafe which is located on Jl Majapahit Malang City carries a different theme compared to other cafes The combination of Javanese and European nuances especially the Netherlands is very strong From the outside the modern feel of the building greets every visitor who enters the cafe Meanwhile when entering the inside of the cafe a number of Javanese antique objects are immediately visible A pair of statues of people dressed in traditional Javanese clothes immediately become an icon on the inside On the inside of the cafe space there is also a large Dutch language inscription Hartelijk Welkom on Malang Huize Djon Geschickt Voor Het Maken Van Mooie Uitstapjes Gezzelige Sfeer Voor Iedere Gast The writing has the real meaning of Welcome to Malang Several ancient European and Javanese ornaments ranging from classic wall clocks made in Germany that are more than 75 years old televisions old radios various leather puppets classic photographs to ancient carvings to decorate the sides of the cafe
The Dutch nuance is also increasingly felt with the inscription in Dutch on the north side of the room namely Uitsmijter Toast Uitsmijter itself is the name of a typical Dutch sandwich while toast means toast
For the menu offered at Huize Jon there are various processed coffees such as Original Wine Robusta Coffe Van Den Berg Wine Robusta Coffe French Press Americano and several other processed coffees However for the superior menu at this place visitors need to try the Dutch special Huize Jon coffe which is Dutch coffee slightly adjusted to be suitable for consumption by the people of Malang For menus other than coffee there are several other choices such as milkshakes tea chocolate or even ginger Apart from drinks this place also provides a food menu such as french fries indomie spring rolls sandwiches and several other menu choices written in Dutch such as Gebakken aardappelen Vleeskroketjes met mustard Pannekoek and various other choices

Coffee shop that has old skool vibes serves a variety of coffee and noncoffee drinks and other snacks at affordable prices

The atmosphere is really good it is recommended to wear a jacket upstairs the air is free so it feels cold
The food and drinks are delicious all of them are good dont be disappointed

Not enough to make you feel at home uno blocks  uno cards

Wafa Coffee n Space the place is cute clean with white and white nuances Apart from looking cute and clean with the white tones on the building Wafa for some reason in my view is just as homey as it is on the 1st floor That doesnt mean the 2nd floor isnt comfortable Judging from the arrangement of furniture and decorative ornaments Wafa seems to have been designed for those of you who want to get together while being productive but also comfortable for those of you who like to drink coffee alone really comfortable

Talking about the menu you will find a lot of mixed drink menus both cold milk coffee variants and noncoffee variants created by Wafa Dont forget there are also heavy meals and snacks you know For heavy meals there are rice bowls with several flavors which to be honest tastes good to me pol mesio I havent tried it in a long time and for snacks you can guess for yourself
For the price Wafa prices its drinks and food at around 15 thousand to 25 thousand if Im not mistaken

The service is good its just that Wafa currently seems to be hampered by the number of human resources so sometimes you have to wait a little longer for your order to arrive
But apparently thats a plus point you know So you can chat first with your friends or something like that

Actually Wafa has a really nice atmosphere Its good for being alone its good for being together but its a shame that Wafas location is on the side of a road which is quite busy with driving activity so its sometimes a bit noisy
But its okay its called the way of many people

Thats about it the rest you can stop by directly at Wafa I hope you all agree with the place menu and service provided by Wafa Xalaam

Place review 
So this outlet has a unique and cool model in my opinion its more like a Korean theme alay like that the seats use private material and the original is nice to look at but this material if it gets hit by rain it will rot and break
This outlet is staffed by mothers and children the mother may be in charge of taking care of food such as donuts waffles etc while the cute and virgin part of the baristastyle drinks its a shame the two of them dont wear cool uniforms like outlets the other one instead wears short shorts wkwkwk tomorrow just wear lingerie so its badaasss but they still feel clumsy in the halter eh not flexible when making the order process the plus point is that the motherchild duo are friendly  one more this outlet is more for take away as a table There are no chairs there are only chairs for waiting for the order only 2 birds

Food review the drinks are manstab abiz semanstab the video is cut tari vs ariel noah oops  the process of making waffles and donuts takes quite a long time even though I saw them using modern equipment I can imagine if you get a lot of orders it will definitely be more complicated and the process will be more delayed takes a long time

Thats all warm greetings from Garangan Elegant

The food and drink menu available here is quite affordable with great taste Because Ive ordered via the Gojek application so Im familiar with the menus One of the recommended and favorite menus here is Butter Rice Chicken Katsu And its just chefs kiss The portion is enough to fill a hungry students stomach after doing the assignment

The owner and Ocil the black and white cat who likes to stop by here are very friendly Ocil seems too friendly just met him and fell asleep on my lap  But that made my experience even more memorable

The place is in the center of city I recommend you to go there in the night because you can see the light along the kayutangan road The food is tasty and the service is very good You should try the rooftop floor

I was here for late lunch and the weather was amazing I decided to dine in upstairs with air breeze in Malang
Ive ordered Dahayu Tea and the taste was refreshing its taste sour and sweet smell just like berries does

Hospitality was amazing I enjoyed the quick order proses with the staff and I did not mind to go downstaird to pick up my order and went back again upstairs

But the meal I was so sad I had to feel disappointed with this food the asparagus chicken
Chicken was served in a hotplate and I hardly wait to try with sauce

Chicken was hot
But the sauce was cold as fff same with the mini croquet and veggies

I do not know what was going on that day but all part of meals should served hot But not for the sauce even when I mixed the cold sauce and hot chicken its meal temperature lowering to room tempie

I love their concept it felt like youre visiting your frineds house and hanging out at their garden The place is not crowded the vibes are chill and the drinks are great They provide a great coffee beans here and the capucino were great my fave
I tried some of their snacks as well and Inlike the avocados one surprisingly good but I think they could only served several sets per day

would def come back again hopefully regulary

You can get to this place because you got lost following the gmaps so stop by As for the place its quite easy to reach the weather is cool the cafe design is okay
But apologize in advance my honest review of the price is not suitable for students The menu was less varied and I was confused about choosing a menu because my stomach didnt go well with coffee and chocolate As a result I ordered chocolate ice  baso aci Baso aci at a price of 20 thousand that I ordered was too expensive because it wasnt worth the filling But the chocolate ice is pretty good
It is hoped that my review can be used as a consideration for evaluating this cafe so that in the future it can grow  be even better Success always

Cozy place Cool not noisy Suitable for refreshing Suitable for family events

Dizzy Coffee French Fries IDR 10000 But PORTIONS ARE MALANG RAYA CHAMPIONS

Wow I never thought that in the Ciliwung area Malang there is really good coffee

Product I ordered Es Coffee Coconut it tasted really good my friend who doesnt like coffee that much took a sip and immediately said mmmm yummmm That means its really good because my friend is the most fussy about food and drink

Price the price is standard but in accordance with the taste The price for Ice Coffee Coconut is only IDR 18000 guys French fries are only IDR 10000 but the portion Masha Allah is a lot guys and the taste is really good too

Place even though I ordered take away but at first glance I saw that the place was quite comfortable for hanging out and the location is on the side of the road so its really easy to find

Service friendly service even though I came with flip flops and all black clothes

Please those who miss good coffee can immediately attack the place

The drinks are great

The place is difficult to find a car park Very roadside location

For the price its still above the lower limit for cafe prices in Malang yes but its worth it because the place is good bro the coffee is also good Price range if Im not mistaken 15k30s

The atmosphere is calm even though the roadside is a bit congested and almost always crowded especially near gacoan you know how to do gacoan for yourself

The only minus is the space which is not too big and not too small while the plus is that there is an individual seat facing the wall The seats are actually proportional to the overall space but I personally think its a bit too small

The majority of seats are outdoor indoor non smoking only 1 seat set I guess

The service is a little above standard which is good because the standard is actually already good If you pay using QRIS QR Code the qr code is printed specifically for customer transactions so you dont need to enter a nominal again like in most cafes today

Tea Bar Leaves

Bored with hanging out at the coffee shop so you can shift to the tea shop The tea here is not just any tea The taste is very unique it is made directly so it is guaranteed to taste fresh and distinctive You can really request if you want sweet or sour The price is also very affordable from 1525 depending on the taste variant The stock is also sometimes empty yes because the seller is deliberately possible so that the original taste doesnt disappear and disappoints

For me who is enjoying tea for the first time its delicious isnt it Friendly and polite service Parking is good for motorbikes There are indoor and outdoor Very close to the highway Comfortable seating both inside and out Toilets are also clean Its cool to just sit and enjoy tea alone or with friends and family

Thirst savior drink with various variants of processed tea and fruit drinks

In my opinion the most recommended are Jasmine Hibiscus and their MoguMogu Tea So refreshing

Apart from drinks there is now a food menu and side dishes such as chicken katsu corn dogs and home made brownies

Often pass by but this is the first time stopping by and finally regretting why I didnt stop by yesterday
The drink is really delicious fresh can be an alternative if you are bored with coffee drinks there are also many variants

The coffee is ok There is no place to eatdrink on the spot There is one on the side with a roof but when I went there during the day it was really dark The chairs in front of the shop were also compacted maybe because of covid

At that time the breads were no longer in the display area so all that was left was the drinks The delicious milk coffee with rum forgot the name Coldbrew Robusta is pretty good too

Whats worse is that the shopkeeper doesnt wear a mask even when making and serving drinks So its a bit ilfeel Even though Im not afraid of Covid thats not the case either There still has to be a health protocol For shop owners please tighten again

But whats a bit annoying is actually the barista might be even cooler if you use a barista apron with the cafe branding Because several times the barista came here wearing the UMM Hospital employee uniform batik So it kind of loses the feel of the cafe a bit

One of the small local coffeeshop that makes me impressed Its because their signature coffee taste differ from another coffeeshop in Malang They are not only following the trend but they pay attention to their quality My favorite is Es Kopi Susu Kane paired it with a freshly homemade donut You have to try it

Drink coffee at home is the concept of this place Built in the baristaowners own house the ambience feels so homey reminds me of my grandpas home back in my hometown somehow But still has a little touch of coffeeshop with a small bar in the corner Has lots of coffee beans from arabika to robusta Tried their filtered tolu batak latte and es susu kopi ice coffee milk tasted good made with manual machine For a non coffee drinker try the Galauincinno ice their special recipe a beverage made of milk coffee ice and palm sugar A unique one but taste really good Affordable price from 5k to 20k

You will never expect a coffee shop at a quite place like this is really traditionally and vintage place with many kind of arabica and robusta coffee you will be spoiled by the whole coffee things

The owner should provide more indoor seats In case of rain the customers will not get wet

I didnt feel comfortable with the crowd during the rain All the customers who sat outside before entered the indoor seat and it became full

Very comfy toilets and praying room Lots of seats with many options of seating to choose from Good food and great atmosphere to do work in Air conditioner everywhere Not very busy during lunch hours

Arrived here around 830pm and was slightly disappointed that most of the items on the menu were sold out Ordered their matcha latte M and was again disappointed by the taste and overpriced price for such simple drink Tasted too sweet and too instant Didnt enjoy it at all My friend ordered popcorn caramel drink and there was no caramel taste at all Also too sweet

It looks so narrow from outside but when you go in its pretty spacious They have izakayastreet decoration and numerous of neon lights Main space is smoking area but they have separated nonsmoking area as well The vibe is so loud with hiphop music and it fits the decoration so well

They mainly sell alcoholic beverages but dont worry they also provide non alcoholic Their cocktail was good all drinks were good on my visit Quite cheap 30kcup for cocktail Very recommended

A brand new place in a center of Malang City strategic place with easy road access
Great place to hangout and drink with friends it has very nice concept and decoration You can feel really different ambience downstairs makes you lost track in time There will be no difference ambience between day and night amazing isnt it Not only they have very nice place they also provide you with extraordinary food and drinks Loud music is a plus to this kind of vibe cant complain 

definitely not my usual kind of scene  i personally cant stand being there for too long since its placed underground and a lot of people smokes there its very stuffy the snack is great though and the drink is okay

New experience for hangout
The cafe with downtown of Tokyos vibes

The Place
The entrance soooooo small I even passing the place twice to make sure of it
So many LEDs to take a picture with Great vibes
Unfortunately not for people who come to chitchat with friends because the music is too loud for me

The Taste
The Miso Ramen taste sooo good The Drink also good and fancy

The Price
Reasonable You can get the fancy dish for around 20k50k

The Service
The service is ok The waiter and cashier are so friendly

also they have working space too
they sell coffee beans and roasted by themselves
i tried the cappucinno they use arabica coffee for the espresso and its good
the minus is the toilet separated with the cafe sharing toilet and its not clean 

Been trying all their menus and their signature just the best
Cozy places divided by smoking and non smoking room
If you want to find a comfortable homie coffee shop with no buzz crowded this just the right place to go

My favorite spot is in the corner next to their roasting room on non smoking area or you even can called it coworking space colokan dimana mana banyak tanaman Makanannya enak they just opened their Aromatic Kitchen

Donuts were super fresh soft but crispy Goes well with our iced coffee A nice place to chill or Do your work

Little coffee shop on the corner of the street Good service nice coffee also serve snacks comes with good price

There is two floor with the 2nd floor and outdoor 1st floor are for smooking good place to work or have a little chat with your friend

You should try their cheesecake It is surprisingly good and itll only cost you IDR 15k I also ordered their Coffee Latte which tasted ok not bad but didnt really meet my expectation I should try another drink for the next visit

The place has a relaxed ambience especially when its not too crowded I sat on the ground floor its a two story high building and people around me were busy with their laptops so I guess its a proper place for you to focus on your work here

Nice industrial vibes and nice grounded coffee blend

One of the cafes in Suhat is located next to the Sahid Montana hotel  This cafe is not too wide but very homey  The table provided is enough for groups and alone  The menu offered is interesting tastes good and has many choices  Chocolate and coffee based drinks are highly recommended  For snacks I recommend churros and fries  One thing that is a little annoying for me personally sometimes too many people smoke so the smoke gathers until the table and my clothes smell of cigarette smoke for passive smokers like me its quite disturbing  Maybe there needs to be another way and regulation to handle my complaint  thanks

First of all nice interior concept just like an old gold mining site I drank their coldbrew and it tastes great mild and fruity Next time Ill go there Id love to enjoy my coldbrew without an ice cube it might taste a lot better Overall as a newcomers they offer a great Australian culture coffeeshop You should go there

Have been trying their several different menus and heres my top three so far
1 Iced hojicha its creamy and thick the flavour is quite deep not overly sweetjust a perfect bittersweet combination
2 French fries with this yellow sauce and mozzarella I forgot the actual name in the menu  because cheese will never be wrong
3 Beef kebab the sauce is exceptional

Unfortunately I cant give any review about their coffee because tbh my body cannot cooperate at all with any coffee intake but I can still say this is a nice place to spend the time The place is not really wide but its super cozy and calmingsuch a perfect workspace Not too crowded but its not empty either Staffs and owner are very humble and friendly and they will explain anything if you ask them about the menu I had a really good time here and I wont be hesitating to visit this place again and try their other menus",925,228.101.661.552.712,6.543.430.498.465.810,2116,"coffee intake, grounded coffee, cooperate coffee, coldbrew tastes, brew nya, hotel cafe, review coffee, cafes suhat, blend cafes, iced coffee"

Located on Brawijaya campus but not only for students
Perfect place to study or chill with an amazing quality of coffee
Lunch and dinner is also possible a little bit european style as well as local dishes

The place for its part of UB is quite comfortable to hang out in It has prayer room musholla and restroom available for the guests I guess the menu has been changed since the first time I visited the place I think some food are somewhat pricey The chicken salad is great so is the tomyam soup But the snacks are overpriced since they in my opinion are far from satisfying

came here because one of my friend suggested to try this place it was good the ambience was the typical coffee shop with bustling sounds of people hanging out with their friends or clacking sounds of people working from the cafe the food came out good but not that tasty the food was a bit expensive if I must say

AADK is a high class concept One of the best cafe where keeps an indoor and outdoor area The ambience of the first floor is very suitable to create a warm friendship sharing love and laugh Theres a photobox there and every corner is so instagramable The atmosphere of the second floor is really appropriate to engage communication and find solution Theres a space to be a workplace and having intense conversation The service is good the menu is also unquestionable and the price is normal and affordable JUST COME OVER AND INVITE ALL OF YOUR FRIENDSFAMILIES YOU WILL FEEL THE COMPLEXITY OF PEACEFULNESS AND BEYOND EXPECTATION

The foods taste great I could tolerate the crunchiness of the chicken katsu while the sauce completes it really well Its savory and creamy
The Meatball also kinda startled us because they use some kinda strawberry sauce Its new for us Surprisingly its sourness and sweetness dont overpower the savory taste of the meatball and mashed potato
For the dessert I picked the matcha cake I could really taste the matcha flavor out of it while its not being too sweet I love it
Id probably revisit the place to try another cake on the selections

Katamichi is 1 of the best and comfiest cafe in town Its decoration is awesome and cute Food and baverage here is delicious you gonna find them cute and lovely as well Recommend this place for hang out with your friend or do your work Their tea and cake is super recommended You also gonna find some cute stuff there

But after all this place is overally good if you put aside the location an vehicle problem and just i said before this place have all you need for a stereotype cafe

The second time ordered Chicken Fajitas I think they have specialty in sauce Again the sauce was superb I want more the sauce

I didnt see if they have baby chair Maybe you can asked them if you plan with your baby I saw prayer place for Muslim and the toilet was cleaned

great coffee they have inhouse roastery and you could buy roasted coffee beans there and ask them to grind it if you didnt have grinder at home the only minus for me is the mushola looks so dirty and hidden in the 2nd floor and didnt really well kept  clean

but I do highly recommend the smoking  nonsmoking room for a casual or business meeting I usually visit Labore after 1900 their night vibe is also lovely

After a hot day wandering lost and stressed around Malang this was such a relaxing place to cool off We felt so happy and relaxed in this beautiful shop surrounded by plants and the sound of bubbling water

They have single origin coffees from around Indonesia which can be brewed in five different ways This was fun to tour We tried the Kintamani brewed in a siphon which was mild with a mango juice they prepared with 100 mango and cream So refreshing Its a little expensive as they have some extra charges for certain taxes which was explained in the menu Just dont be surprised by the bill

The ambiance is the strongest point along with a great menu of drinks and food

Cosy open air caf with extensive menu for both international and local food We came here for the espressos and they really hit the spot We indulged on an affogato and ginger latte as well as some delicious pancakes and roti bantal with chocolate

Wonderful decor and experience for a foreigner like me to see the batik masks and other traditional puppets We went between meals but The food looked amazing and I would love to go back and try it

There was an outdoor picnic set up for groups interesting

I only go there once and i think i will think twice to go there again I appreciate their concept of making a cafe with a nice scenery in the evening They have some chairs and tables in the yard So you can have chit chat either with your friends or your boyfriendgirlfriend I like one of the menu banana nugget However the serious point is that i think the menu are overprice for some ppl like me Also they dont offer various menu to be selected

Cant take a proper picture yet rest assured it was a nice place to hang out However i hope that there are more food options in the menu

Great place to hangout with friends and family A lil bit cold at night because its semi outdoor place dont forget to bring your jacket or warm suit Super cozy atmosphere

Plus point for their nice quiet and cozy ambience But not a fan for what they serve Coffee taste not so good and their mashed potato is bland with no creamy taste at all Or maybe I just pick the wrong dish Improve your dishes and drink and maybe Ill consider another visit

Will definitely be my favourite coffee shop in Malang The coffee is superb Try pour over V60 Gayo wine beans Sooo light and clear And surprisingly its not really expensive for such a fragrant and tasty coffee The place So much greeny and peaceful Its got a concept a vintage house A house during Dutch colonization I feel like in my grandmas house in the village

The second time we comeback here the pancakes was seduced me
Price really ok for the good pancakes 15k for the single basic pancake
And caramel macchiato  pasta was ok Ricebowl also still worth it
Cozy place to chill maybe work little bit chit chat maybe little bit chill music make this place more cozy
but one thing little bit bothering me that I had to sit next to active smokers people who smoke all the time even I told him that is bother us

LOVE PLACE BEST VIEWS

After not being here for a long time I was surprised it turned out that the cafe had been renovated in such a way In the past this cafe was very simple with a sky roof and vines now this cafe has turned into an aesthetic cafe with various ornaments In the past the outlets were only available at certain points now the outlets are made evenly spread in almost every corner The place is getting nicer and more comfortable then the price is also still in the pocket of students For the menu then and now there have been many changes even almost all of the menus are new menus In the past the heavy food menu was only indomie rice noodles now the heavy food menu is quite varied and suitable to fill the stomach while enjoying the breeze in the afternoon What I really miss about this place are the cute cats There used to be a jet black village cat whose voice was very cute and made me miss Yesterday when I visited again unfortunately did not meet the black cat Really recommended this place

The place is comfortable It is recommended to come here at night with friends The most delicious place lesehannya In addition to the availability of wifi there is also a wall socket for those who want to charge their cellphones or laptops at the sitting area You can read contemporary books at the crosslegged area and you can borrow a guitar or a card from the receptionistcashier to play with friends",925,5.557.806.981.995,6.491.673.420.945.980,2273,"love place, place comfortable, relaxing good, turned cafe, cafe turned, place cute, vines cafe, village cat, recommended place, cafe renovated"

Because the location is inaccessible to vehicles its better to park on the side of the main road or in the main square

Their food indeed indulge our tastebud surprisingly

Yet I have to be honest serving speed is Bhavas weak point While only one other table occupied by customers a 30minute wait for one of 4 meals in the order to appear is never good enough If 4 of the tables are occupied by families simultaneously the last to submit order may have to watch an empty table for 2 hours with growling tummy

 For service it was still lacking at that time my order was not delivered to the table I thought it was self service but it turned out that there was a customer behind me whose order was delivered to his table even though it was quiet at that time and the employee sat in front of the cashier and when he came home too play hp Hopefully in the future there will be no customer exceptions

cozy and good coffee

The place is very comfortable clean and also seems simple not a fancy cafe The coffee menu is very diverse and is also served from various coffee beans that we can choose for ourselves For the price it is still standard in the class of cafe cafes that sell contemporary coffee

But yesterday when I ordered manual brew v60 the taste of the coffee was still lacking in my opinion either because the coffee beans were not fresh or something else that I didnt know

Hopefully the owner of the teacher and also the barista will always improve their brewing skills so that the quality and taste of the coffee will be better

Comfortable quiet and most importantly the coffee is special

A friend recommended Awal Bermula Cafe and Eatery At first I did not have much expectation but after my visit I can say that it is a perfect spot to hangout with friends work on your computer or simply enjoy a plate of snack and drink
Even though Awal Bermula is located on a busy street across Pasar Blimbing once you are inside it is quiet Their food and drink were okay between 2030K It also has some seatings on the 2nd floor
One major turnoff is parking Parking space is tiny fit two cars and twothree motorcycles or six motorcycles Take ridehailing service will save you from headache

The beverages is good the vibe in such a place is amazing for a dinner and chill time Customer can enjoy the view from above to the road

Fruitbar  Im so happy to meet you
I ordered for the first time via gofood
I ordered a fruit salad
Its great The contents of the fruit also include a lot even though the price is also cheap
The mayonnaise and cheese are just right
I havent tried other menus yet but next time I will order again here
Highly recommended

The best one is the durian soup fruit soup The star who talked has not been able to take a photo

In the photo below the fruit salad is no less fresh and the mayonnaise is original 

the product is great The fruit soup is really full of fruit Ive also tried durian soup very good The thick gravy really tastes like durian The most important price is roadside prices In cafes its probably 20k and above

great My favorite durian fruit soup Good portion and taste If in other places with this portion the price is much more expensive Its on gofood too

In my opinion the most delicious and thick juice is in the fruitbar unfortunately not many people know only put in go food",925,12.736.641.000.405,6.478.820.992.300.120,2457,"cheap mayonnaise, gofood opinion, salad fresh, fruitbar unfortunately, fruitbar im, salad great, expensive gofood, fruit include, durian fruit, durian soup"

Good drink
Good Price

From the outside it looks like an ordinary small cafe but it turns out to be a very proper restaurant The interior is super nice and well laid out clean and tidy the green tones are really pretty

The service is very good you dont have to wait too long for the food  drinks to come out The ambiance is really nice and makes you feel at home for long The music played is mostly jazz perfect for casual conversation

For food and drinks tend to be pricey It looks okay but the taste is really ordinary for that price The hazelnut milkshake has lots of ice cubes then the cream itself is half a glass As far as I know a milkshake should have milk and ice cream blended together not hazelnut milk add ice cubes and then add whipped cream to half a cup The straws use paper straws its good to care for the environment but it makes it hard to drink the cream

If the latte is okay served with cookies and sugar separately It feels great

Love the atmosphere and the food
It is worth the price And it is quite cheap compare to other cafes in Malang

However it took soooo much time for the food to be ready Maybe because its always crowded with people
Also they played the music so loud So you might reconsider to visit this place if you like a quiet place But they also provide a special room for study or work so you might use that

Dont ride a car to visit this place its hard to find the parking lot

Semusim Cafe is on St MT Haryono Malang exactly across from Brawijaya University This cafe has two floors which are always busy every day with visitors who are mostly students This cafe sells cheap food and drinks so it is suitable for student pockets prices start from 7000 to 20000 This cafe is open every day open from 1000 to 0000 This cafe has a Scandinavian decoration concept so it is very interesting to visit and apart from that this cafe also has airconditioned first floor facilities there are sockets on each table without worrying about running out of battery as well as a prayer room for Muslim visitors Meanwhile the second floor is a smoking zone as well as a place to carry out tasks This floor cafe is nonAC it wont feel hot because of the lots of ventilation and the use of fans to provide extra comfort to visitors

Other foods are also delicious The portion is reasonable for the price

The staff is just OK not significantly Javanese friendly 
They should just smile a little when taking order and serving the food

Life changing No exaggeration I never eaten paru before and never liked organs But my girlfriend introduced me to kopi sontoloyos nasi paru and it really is very delicious Now everytime i go to malang ill spare a day to visit here to eat the nasi paru as well as take away some frozen one to bring back to Jakarta It really is really good

Unfortunately since there was no indoor seating available we had to pick outdoor tribune to enjoy our orders and it wasnt a nice experience The weather was windy and a bit chilly so you can imagine how uncomfortable it is Plus the tribune is not suitable for eating something served on a plate

The lime drink is served in a large jug unlike some resto we visited before Very generous portion not too much ice cubes

The interior is vintage There is a collection of motorcycles in front of the main entrance Its nice to see if youre into bikers But I think it took up too much space The outdoor area has only 2 sets of tables We chose outdoor because the nonsmoking area is not available

It was our first time and we got a pouch of signature coffee powder for free because we spent more than 250k

Nice and cozy place and they have smoking outdoor and nonsmoking indoor areas separated Free Wifi and power outlets are available I think the number of the tables is a little bit small not surprising because the place is not big Nevertheless with the right and nice interiors and light it feels spacious enough They apply the new normal protocol so we found that some tables are not in used I think the chair could be imrpoved though I certainly like it if it more comfortable especially if I want to do my work in the place
We tried the apple pie which is part of the pastries displayed at the front counter It was scrumptious with the perfect crispy flaky dough and the right sweetness and sourness of the apple filling The caesar salad comes as a combination of lettuces generous amount of grilled chicken and a slice of garlic bread but with different dressing than the usual yellow caesar dressing I used to know It uses some kind of mayonnaise combined with certain herbs and spices I think Kinda tasted the parsley in the dressing somehow It tasted nice and fresh
The salted spicy tofu is good although I prefer mine to be a little bit more salty It comes with a separate sauce made of sweet soy sauce and chili flakes The vegetables cream soup tasted good but the texture is somehow quite thick reminds me of a very thick porridge instead of soup Theyre certainly generous with the amount of the vegetables however
The chocolatemilk is quite nice while the iced lemon tea is proved to be a hit for me definitely want to order it again Were lucky enough to get a free ice cream waffle with minimum 100K rupiahs purchase choose between chocolate strawberry or banana one The strawberry waffle comes with strawberry ice cream strawberry slices strawberry jam and whipped cream that I found very rare used in the waffle sold here in the city The offer will last until the end of August by the way

It was a good place to kill the time with your mates The place is quite easy to reach and also comfortable to chill or doing some work The menu is interesting because youll find different variant of coffee that rarely served at another coffee shop in malang like salted caramel coffee and also caramel macchiato which as far I know I can only find it at starbucks coffee The minus is the lighting at night that just not the same the indoor and outdoor area thats just look not so good And also the concept of the indoor area was so so I mean not really special But over all the caramel macchiato was good 

I tried their latte and it was real good It was served in a cute cup without a teaspoon as other cafes would do But I enjoyed it much Also their cireng bumbu rujak is refreshing

Good place with homey vibe and of course the Cappuccino is great for me with such price

Nice little coffee shops ample outdoor space decent power outlets good selection of beverage The baristas were kind and polite just make sure to ask them if there is any requests about your order theyll be happy to help you or you just want to chit chat with them The only downside is there isnt any decent parking space you must park your vehicle beside the road and the road just too damn narrow 35 2 points for the availability of the parking space All and all very recommended",8.999.999.999.999.990,332.310.542.465.119,6.399.693.162.739.530,2675,"know starbucks, teaspoon cafes, man cafe, coffee minus, starbucks, coffee caramel, served coffee, caramel coffee, cafes enjoyed, concept coffee"

Love their outdoor ceiling because they use clear ceiling

A coffee shop that has a unique concept in Malang is different from other coffee shops It gets an 810 for ambiance because its cute and unique There are also quite a lot of seats provided but the place is not too wide for a coffee shop because it is located in a residential area It looks like this coffee shop is only suitable for chatting with friends and not for doing assignments because the place is quite noisy and crowded so its not comfortable if you need a place thats not noisy For food and drink I give a rating of 910 because it is delicious and unique and the price is cheap Various kinds of drinks and food are provided here From snacks to heavy meals and in my opinion all the menus dont fail because they match their appearance with what is on the menu Service 8510 due to selfservice drinks and food delivered by the waitress Besides that for those of you who like to take pictures here a photobox is provided for which of course a separate fee is charged

The food and drinks Ive ordered always taste right on my buds

I fell in love with the place thanks to the sofas area on the 2nd floor They look a lot like a family restaurant in the west lol Its cute and private The WiFi is fast and consistent so you definitely can study work or just enjoy your netflix comfortably I always visited the place in the morning till afternoon so far and its never been too crowded Perhaps because I havent stop by at its peak hour

Their drink tastes alright and the pricing is no different than other cafs around IDR 20K and up We bought a toast and mozzarella stick hmm the taste and presentation can be improved

Theres a lot of seating arranged for small to large group We went there around 8 PM and sat on the 2nd floor terrace I tell you its not the best place to enjoy the night Although the cafe itself located in a strategic place with good parking space the road is way too busy and noisy for you to hold a proper conversation without raising your voice Even though the 1st floor music sounds a bit louder I suppose its better that way because youd hear less noise from the busy road",8.999.999.999.999.990,306.258.322.237.017,6.391.877.496.671.100,2680,"comfortably visited, family restaurant, netflix comfortably, coffee shop, best place, typical cafe, place enjoy, indoor place, twostory cafe, work cafe"

It is very sad tho they could learn something about supply chain management and communication between team to prevent this kind of issue

The service is good the cashier and one of the waiters are friendly and answer all our questions despite the crankyness we had hungry due to waiting for an hour

at first glance the shop is sometimes not visible because the place where the shop rises up and is covered by a tree in front of the house

Found this warkop by accident when passing through Cor Jesu It turns out to be a humble and nice place to chat There are several types of drinks and the prices are still affordable Plus on weekends you can have morning coffee here interesting

If by chance its late and you are looking for a place to drink coffee or tea you can come here especially after the rain it is suitable to cover and drink warm drinks here

For the drinks themselves there is coffee and quite a wide selection of teas I personally think the selection of teas is quite unique and worth trying all of them I tried the milk tea myself and its quite suitable for the taste maybe next time Ill ask for the level of sweetness to be reduced Then had time to try the lemon grass eggplant Unique warm and fresh thats the description Perfect for accompanying the evenings after the rain

For food there are some snacks that can accompany your cup of coffee or tea please check whats available

As for the seats themselves on the side of the road around this warkop area there are quite a lot of chairs so dont worry about not getting a place Likewise the parking area is also wide and guarded by parking officers safe

The coffeeshop itself is only a building for the bar area And in my opinion the arrangement is really neat starting from the decoration with retro items then the arrangement of the tea jars and tools is neat its nice to see It also makes you feel at home looking at the bar and then seeing the crowd around Accompanied by the sound of the street The point is serene

Also when I ordered a cheese cake the cashier said it was available so I paid for it but after a while she said it was sold out Finally I ordered another cake and the cashier said the change would be given to me later but she didnt give it to me until I finally asked for it myself as I was planning to leave

Super ecstatic to have an authentic bingsoo place in Malang I mean the bingsoo that usually being sold in my hometown usually the cheap version But Timtong elevated it close to the actual bingsoo supposed to be

It was delicious the ice shaved is so soft and creamy because it was made from creamy milk and processed using the real bingsoo machine The red bean on my Azuki Matcha is also royal I mean they gave me lots of it so it is guaranteed youre gonna be satisfied to have one bowl of shared bingsoo here

The single serving is actually for 2 portion and the sharing serving can be enjoyed by 34 person The price is affordable Place is comfy but too small and often had long queue The sweetener is using honey Anyway they also sell refreshing drinks and tea which are also hard to miss

Beware of the queue as it gets so long on weekend Pricewise is cheap as the portion is big The main dish served at 0900 but it opens at 0700 so if you come before 0900 you have to wait for the dish to be served Really love the rice pot because i think it only sold here The kungpao is dominant with sweet taste but really great I recommend you all to order the milo tarik cause its super great

Arriving at this place this place was pretty empty It was around 2 in the afternoon The room design was simpleit is more like dull square chairs and rectangular brown tables Definitely nothing about its atmosphere attracts people to come The street at its front was noisy and it is a huge oven with metal roof ready to bake anyone Probably it is so since there is no tree around it

The coffee was actually fine yet it does nothing to reduce the inconveniences The perfect disaster brought by its french fries It was served on a plate of 20 cm of diameter and looked slightly wet When I touched it was really damp seemed like soaked in cooking oil rather fried And thanks to the fries bland taste my disappointment was complete

I still do not understand the reason people coming back to this place

The ambiance of the cafe was simply amazing with the old grandma style house and interiors full of wooden style furniture that added to the overall charm of the place The windows provided a stunning view of the nearby stream accompanied by the soothing sound of flowing water It was the most unique cafe I have ever been to and I was immediately taken aback by the tranquility and serenity of the surroundings

The menu was equally impressive offering a range of delicious food and beverages I tried their pisang bakar and it was one of the best Ive ever had The rate of the menu is very cheap as well

All in all I would highly recommend this cafe to anyone looking for a unique and memorable experience The ambiance the food and the service are all outstanding making it an ideal place to relax and unwind I look forward to visiting again soon

The decoration is superb its like an oriental museum Perfect for someone who loves antique or unique building and someone who loves taking photo The water sound came from the river and the fish pond make a relaxing ambiance But sadly there is no smoking room in this cafe so the visitor can smoking everywhere and its make me uncomfortable The taste of main menu is so so and a little bit salty The tea is good tho The price is really affordable

This place has so many beautiful spot including the theme building style which have unique design both the building and the interior antique things the garden the fish pool and its surroundings that so homey was really good for instagram and heaven for people who love taking picture Foods and beverages was average enough My two cents of this place would be the connection both menus and the ambiece because the menus notthatoriental antique contradicts enough with the ambience

Good vibes cafe with such a good books collection like Yuval Noah Hararis books Not that pricey also The menus price ranged from around Rp 10000  Rp 30000

Many potential photo backgrounds at Bataputi Coffee House The most favorite is the outer part of the cafe which has white rattan tables and chairs We can take photos with 3 backgrounds at once a wooden gazebo which is part of the smoking area the Bango River and the trees on its banks that divide Araya Housing and the magnificent Araya Bridge Now the chandelier that adorns the Araya Bridge lights up brightly before night falls Not only does it add to the coolness of your photo background but it also makes the night atmosphere warm and romantic

Just open every day at 3 pm on weekends Bataputi Coffee House starts to get busy at 5 pm Visitors generally aim to sit in the gazebo and nonsmoking rooms that are airconditioned and have sofas Besides being a fun place the food and drinks offered by Bataputi Coffee House are affordable We tasted two coffee drinks recommended by the friendly cafe staff namely avocado coffee and the other which is only available on weekends es kopi susu tempo doeloe

The coffee in avocado coffee is still quite dominant even though it is served with vanilla ice cream So if you like light coffee the creamy tempo doeloe iced coffee is more suitable Moreover the special thing is that this milk coffee ice is served with market snacks the types of which depend on availability

Heavy meals range from pizza burgers to rice pasta and noodle based ones Afternoon is the right time for snacking so we ordered two snacks that cost around tens of thousands of rupiah fried bananas gula Jawa and onion rings The onion rings are crunchy and delicious to eat warmly However you must order the Javanese sugar fried banana which is not sprinkled with meises and cheese as usual but in a traditional style with a sprinkling of brown sugar and young coconut

Open MondaySunday 15002300 WIB

One of the best cafes in Malang to relax unwind and be close to the nature Its really difficult finding a caf that has a good view and not just fake plants inside the building for pure decorative purpose Bataputi has a wide selection of food  beverages and in my experience they all taste good

Prices are reasonable staffs are helpful Wifi could be improved a little bit especially in the outdoor area But all in all a perfect choice for a me time or to hang out with friends and family

To be honest I was a bit unsure to come to this place until last month It was driven by the fact that lots of eatery and coffee house were open offering merely their good look
Bataputi however indeed has good look especially for its interior and location by the river bankand offers great food I find the basic menu such as fried rice satisfactory The fresh ingredients and combination of spices bring the savor everyone is looking for Should one need to indulge in some comfort food accompanied by friendly coffee while enjoying afternoon breeze Bataputi is the one to visit The best time to be here is from 36 pm
The prices might be higher than average around Malang but it worth the money spending for

my first impression was the menu is really variative with affordable price range the croissant is also really good crispy yet buttery definitely must try i really like the iced coffee latte i also ordered caesar salad which surprisingly came in big portion definitely will come back to try other menu

I remembered that this bakery was succesfully made a good impression to me especially for their ciabatta bread but i think recently their quality is not as good as before Its still enjoyable but i have to say that they could be better

I have no complaint for anything about the food It taste good fair portion for the price Waiters are all giving their best service I just not really enjoy the ambience I dont get the concept Its too formal to be a cafe but its too loud and casual to be a fine dining place I hope they could work this out because i love their Nasi Seafood Siram Woku and looking forward to have another dine in

Good food big portion and clean place Although the price is expensive the taste and the portion are worthed The service is very welcome I can say it is one of the best restaurant in Malang

Good food even I can say the price is so cheap for delicious and  cool plating 

The food is okay although it was served not quite warm but the service is very bad First you have to wait a long time for your food Secondly I dont understand why tourists have to pay in advance when Indonesians can pay just like in any decent restaurant after eating a meal just before leaving
I dont really know what the reason is is it racism against white people

I went there around 10pm and it was so crowded
Tbh it was so cold so if you cant bear the coldness prepare your jacket since its Malangs night

I ordered regular STMJ and my friend ordered chocolate SMJ Milk with honey and ginger also some tofu and toast
It was so crowded and it was Saturday that we wait the drink for 40 minutes
Bcs it was my first time there idk wether that was categorized as long time or not
But we waited the drink and food for long time  in my opinion 
The stmj was good I didnt feel the raw egg
And the tofu was smooth The toast also good

Actually its gonna be a late review cause ive been here for like a month ago Ok next so from my opinion is Sudut Coffee is just like others coffee shop startup like a plain concrete chair small rock in the floor you know what it is But it is not a bad thing nor a good things For the coffee its the same thing but here they serve their signature jamaican something i kind a forget and i belive its mixed with some rum but correct me if im wrong The last things is the cookies which is good i like it Overall its okay for me

Good place and cozy the baverages taste good but nothing special the price is standard

Coffee  conversations or just online gaming with friends cannot be separated  Sudut Coffee is one of the meeting points for students workers and colleagues who want to spend time together or just doing task  Sudut Coffee serves you with selected menu at affordable prices  Wifi are available An interesting offer is Morning Coffeetime starts at 0800  1100 pm just for IDR 10000

The staffs were friendly quick The place of course is the main attraction here But the drinks were nothing special that prices around 2529k the mushroom pizza was fine tho french fries is just like the regular french fries in some other restos which fast food branches still taste better

I came here on the weekend and it is too crowded Every table is placed too close from one another Im wondering if they correctly follow the pandemic protocol for caferestaurant  Especially the indoor dinein area isnt that too crowded They should lessen the tables

The food is good
The staffs especially the security is sooooo friendly and helpful 

The pizza and the burger tastes nice Staffs were kind of friendly The location is quite nice as well although its very small The problem is that it took way too long for the food to come out Thats the thing that gives an illusion of this place being crowded at all times Not because of they have a lot of customers but because of slow service Had the food taste bad I wouldve rate it 15

Cozy place

Previously there was no intention to bring down any other place But seriously bro Ive been here many times when I pass by and want to warm it up Theres a conclusion I can draw even though the place is oldfashioned like this the quality is still legendary In fact this is more suitable than the one across from the one in Glintung The taste of the milk is fresh and super delicious the freerange chicken eggs are also of very good quality And the super ones who serve are just as cool as former artists in the 80s  polite and friendly too For lovers of stmj its not complete if you dont come here let alone those from outside the city is stuck to the poor

Really nice place to get relax here good foods taste friendly prices for metry it you wont regret it

the place is decent the employees are many the food is also not bad the drinks that I ordered are also okay

there was a message
fried noodles boiled noodles rainbow toast cheese toast roasted corn taro pure milk ice chocolate milkshake ginger wedang chocolate ice warm orange

I think the taro milk doesnt taste like the milk but it takes a long time to taste the taro thats it the chocolate milkshake is okay then the rainbow toast color is like that  at first you can see it on tiktok the color is really pretty but its worth it the price is good but for those who like a lot of stuffing its perfect if you like standard itll be bad because theres a lot of stuffing but the grilled corn is also delicious its been printed one by one so its easier to eat the onion rings are not bad either

the service is okay friendly and good too maybe because its a bit crowded okay for student pockets its also worth it but because its a family here its okay its safe and the location is next to the main road so its easy to find thats okay  thankyou success continues and maintain the service and taste

Roti Bakar Om Doel in Sawojajar Malang is a place to eat that is worth a try for toast lovers The price offered is very affordable so you dont need to worry about spending a lot of money The taste of the toast here is very delicious and satisfying especially with the variety of toppings that you can choose according to your taste

This dining area is also quite spacious and has a comfortable atmosphere so it is perfect for enjoying toast with family or friends Unfortunately the service here is rather slow and unsatisfactory However this does not reduce the quality and taste of the toast offered

The mint tea is delicious and very fresh Ask for less sugar but still sweet The place is small you cant hang out there are only long benches for sitting The place is rather small but crowded because it is in the campus and boarding house area The parking lot is a bit cramped on the road if its just for motorbikes its enough for cars its rather difficult

Drink shops with quite affordable prices there are various kinds of variants ranging from fruit variant teas fresh milk and yakult mixes are also available

Order the passion fruit tea orange juice and Thai tea variants request less sugar but still sweet Maybe you can reduce the sugar content a bit

For the passion fruit tea it would be better if it had the original passion fruit pulp so it would be fresher

In terms of service including fast yes the packaging is also okay

I like Gleks mint tea the mint is quite strong

Vapestore top 

Good

Good place

It was the first time I went to a vape store in Malang and my expression was WOW WOW WOW Why According to me

1 The location factor its very comfortable here the room is airconditioned the atmosphere is relaxed the arrangement of the place is minimalist and neat so that it is eyecatching with the products being sold but there are still minuses starting from the lack of seats so that it is less supportive for a place to hang out and share knowledge after buying a product or just sharing with the owner

2 Service factor TOP MARKOTOP the owner is super friendly to me who is illiterate in vaping he still gives knowledge in a fun and easy to understand way so I understand and am satisfied with the questions I asked the store owner he too Patiently answering my questions even though I actually understand a little

3 Product factors and product prices in this case I am still okay with the products being sold and offered to me because the prices and products here are almost all vape stores selling what this shop sells I havent found any rare products being sold here or maybe I dont know which products are rare or not

Conclusion
I give this shop a score of 95 out of 100 because its not from the location and product factors but from the friendly and friendly service I feel like Im talking to my own friends

Suggestions and critics
To store owners
Please extend your stores opening hours so that customers who dont have time in the morning or afternoon can visit your store at any time
Please add seats for customers so they can linger the goal is to feel comfortable and be able to share knowledge with fellow vape users and with you as a shop owner
If you have added a hanging out facility dont forget to make it complete provide soft drinks for your customers to buy so that it will be more comfortable and crowded with customers

Thats all from me thank you for your service

Nice

I think this cafe is out of the box
Other times whats the chicken or the meat
But what is raised is seafood like fish and so on
In terms of cafe design its the same as usual
But the food is really good
The taste is unique and the sauce is the same as the grilled fish
Over all I like it
At first I didnt like it and didnt really like to eat fish
Even though the pantura people
After eating there the mainset was pretty much eroded eaa
It turns out that fish is no less delicious than chicken if you make it geprek
Same with nampool already
Lets just try it not until 2200 yaa

Looking for a date place while eating cheaply Yes at Iwak Cafe This place is really recommended and definitely very instagramable Apart from being a very strategic place namely on Jl Kedungombo Dam No 7 Malang is near the ITN campus and is indeed a culinary location for Ngalam students this place is also comfortable not too crowded Very suitable for a date with a partner

I recommend Cwie Mie with gizzard liver topping because it tastes great

Kouja is instagramable place for you to hang out and gathering with your friends Has a photobooth This place is also able to be a venue of the event

Great new cafe with different concept

The location is a row of cafes
The parking is wide

It just seems unkempt The location is in front of Sarijan Cafe Very spacious inside perfect for assignments and meetings

If you say its instagramable in my opinion 710 depending on the motto you have to have flat angels

Service it seems the staff is minimal so its not optimal when I went there in the afternoon before maghrib Thats it theres no food Drinking is also limited And the taste of the coffee is not worth the price I feel like Nescafe At that time I was a student and I was there Why did he say this drink tastes like pop ice

There are toilets and mushollah just like that I want to go to the toilet and the mushollah is really not clean heaps of piles of gt The toilets are clean the mushollah needs to be cleaned especially for prayer

If cleanliness is not maintained and the quality of the food is not improved you are worried that you will go out of business especially since there are so many cafes around that are much cleaner and cheaper and taste good

Visit this place after it got promoted by a local IG food reviewer Nothings special about this coffeeshop Price are a bit expensive for that size of coffee Dish needs forever to be served Cant find a nonsmoking table unless those one outside

I like the ambience the drinks are great I ordered strawberry creamy and ice coffee mantra The strawberry creamy is basically like strawberry milk with the exact sweetness based on my likes The ice coffee mantra which is specialty in this cafe but I think isnt special because the taste is like basic ice coffee milk imo
The place is great for hang out with your friends but not really great for those of you who want to be alone because its pretty crowded

Location 55 easy to find
Place 35 great interior I like the wall painting and painting in a frame very creative But I think the cafe should put more ventilation because sometimes customers are smoke in the indoor room I found it pretty stuffy for indoor room
Price 45 affordable prices according to the quality of the food

Aesthetic place with limited menu to choose Food is fairpriced considering the quantity and taste Air circulation is problematic if you sit inside in a humid hot weather and smoking area is basically everywhere Waiter cook and barista are all very welcoming Worth the visit with group of friends but not intimate place for couples

great heritage architecture

The ambiance at Golden Sand is comfortable warm and calm Interior design is also suitable to be combined with buildings that are indeed Dutch heritage

For food the portions and prices are standard and reasonable As for the taste its also delicious theres nothing to complain about

Waiter service is also very friendly and smiling Big applause for the waiter and the barista

My only complaint might be the different prices between the menu and those on the bill for some foods the price can go up 1025k from what is on the menu book For drinks it can actually be 25k cheaper than the menu book Maybe the menu book can be updated so that customers can be more comfortable

Overall still a great place great food and great ambiance Will I come back here Of course The comfortable atmosphere succeeds in making me want to come back to taste other dishes But for now 4 stars first if there is improvement in the future 5 stars for sure

Well I just paid then even though it felt uncomfortable with his attitude

Probably the most impressive thing this cafe can offer is the ambience of the surrounding Very vibrant as many random people are wandering The coffee itself is good but not great Price wise is affordable pretty much similar to other similar cafe types Come here with 3 to 4 friends and enjoy coffee time

the place is comfortable there is also a prayer room so there is no need to bother looking for another place to pray

I love this place A really cheap coffee with killer taste Taste and smell it but the most important thing was having a conversation with random people was great Unfortunately if you are an antismoke person dont visit this place too many smoke of cigarettes but it is good for social interraction

Ambience and the staffs were okay but after waiting for like 40 mins which is  long if you ask me the foods and drinks that came together were all served cold Not the best option considering the pricing is pretty standard for similar cafes yet my drink tasted nothing like what i ordered Came here to work on my laptop but the wifi is down and even if theyd work staffs said the wifi got a time limit for 3 hours Like
This was like my 4th time here and before this my experiences were ok if not the best but this would be my last Wont be coming back again

Took a long time for the food to come out no table service so we have to wait for the food downstairs Ordered some cupped drinks and one of it wasnt sealed properly so it spilled everywhere when carried
Someone else also took my order without the cashier noticed Maybe they should have put numbersnames in an order so its easy to call out the order and no one will mistakenly take other peoples order
The place itself is nice but its crowded and sometimes theres a selfish customer that takes table for 4 by themselves
The menu wasnt updated I came here for Tacos as they have it on the menu on Google Maps but when I came here they dont have it For Malang standard its quite overpriced

wait for approximately 30 minutes and the server ended up saying the food that i ordered was out of stock coffee milk shouldve named it MILK coffee barely tasted any coffee

This coffee shop is so wellknown arround the students in Malang because this places included as the most productive coffee shops for discussion and another agendas Its also commonly called as Gusdurian a group of people who follow the value of Gus Dur 4th President of Indonesia basecamp and also the place for meeting and discussion by another communities tho There are many books in the first floor and its actually has 3 floors This place is not only sold the coffee but also tea milk hot chocolate and so on

this place live up to its name it provides light drinks coffee and small snacks theres a decent public library means you dont need to worry if you forgot to bring your books wifi are also available if youre in for some productivity tasks parking is not shaded and its on the side of the street directly may not suitable for dating but best for group discussion

EDIT several days ago I went back and found out if you want to do events here you need to secure mininum purchase of several hundred thousand rupiahs If you cannot do that they charge you additional money But not all the menus are available for us to purchase Most of them are sold out but they dont care if we couldnt reach the mark we still need to pay the money How could we fulfill their minimum purchase if we cannot order anything I lowered my points from 4 to 2 Still a good place but not recommended for meeting

I went here for a casual meeting with my friend They ran out of the snack and meals I could ordered iced taro only The price was cheap I was surprised the photo in the Google maps didnt match the reality The place was kinda dirty They might havent mopped the floor for a really long time There were thick layer of dust above the books on the shelf I was having my drink in the rooftop The rooftop was dirty and kinda dark There were only one or two light bulbs The toilet was in the second story it was really smelly and disgusting Poorly maintained place

Its really nice to hang out here actually especially if you host a discussion event or simply want to meet people and talk upon some issues in depth For this oase cafe regulars are activists and intellectuals

I was hosting a discussion event inviting some groups several days ago The management charges us 210k rupiah for minimum purchase

What really disappoint me is
1 they didnt explain that there will be minimum purchase before the dday
2 I was and am really okay with the minimum purchase its small amount of money I was really sure the crowd will exceed the minimum purchase by ordering several drinks and food BUT THEY ONLY SERVED DRINKS THE MEALS ON THEIR MENU WERE NOT AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT YET THEY STILL INSIST FOR US MAKING IT TO MINIMUM PURCHASE
how could you expect your customer to order a bag of air or a plate of disappointment and inconvenient and swearing never come back there again smh
3 They even didnt let us start our event until we make it to minimum purchase I do understand that your company pushed you hard to meet our obligation as client sir But please you should have informed me before the dday and providing solving to the situation too
4 I was complaining to the management after the event finished they told me that IF I DIDNT MAKE THE MINIMUM PURCHASE I HAD TO GIVE THEM THE SPARE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CHARGED US
Excuse you sir but your company fail to cater us the food you promised to serve And you expect us to get our money for bags of air and plates of disappointment Thank you

The place is decent I would say I especially loved the interior and outdoor settings The cafe has transformed the dutch building with blue and white stylings Quite different what you easily see for me the architecture stand out when I was driving my motorcycle piqued my curiosity
The coffee was fine not the best Expecting the manual V60 Japanese brew to be more delicate but its mainly depend on the barista to bring out the taste

I think this is one of those cafes where you can spend time chatting with a group of friends Well its great for couples too but I think the vibe is not so much suitable for that
First time at Hindia we ordered hazelnut latte some kind of tea and their platter menu Well I cant say something special about those three menus
But I think they need to reconsider putting away those tables placed on the outer side of the outdoor area

It is a coffee shop and eatery as well Coffee is basically prepared from a group of selected beans with a coffee machine so there is nothing special The menu is rather complete offering main dishes and snacks The price is affordable and the location is strategic

Good beverages I ordered avocado coffee and its pretty okayish The food surprisingly came out really good We ordered kwetiau and banana fritters The kwetiau was great meanwhile the banana was okay The place overall was comfortable but the service wasnt that great We asked for smoking area and directed to non smoking area just to be scolded by another waiter lol",8.500.000.000.000.000,204.365.194.233.775,6.011.309.558.270.130,3847,"depend barista, beverages need, beans coffee, food spacious, good beverages, curiosity coffee, cafe transformed, cafes spend, japanese brew, think cafes"

For those who dont know and want to know
Whats an ice pot
The ice pot is marni colored ice cream placed in a small pot which also has various colors and is decorated with toppings according to your wishes
It can be chocolate granules fruit jelly colorful candies and chocolate milk which makes the ice cream just unique
This ice cream doesnt taste much different from the ice cream we usually eat
Its just that its made in a very unique and funny way sometimes its a shame to eat it
This ice was very popular at the time its just normal now
In Malang its in the food court Malang Town Square or commonly called MATOS
But the 1st floor is near the stairs
More or less priced at 1015 thousand per portion Im very satisfied with choosing my favorite topping 1 topping 1 top layer yes
If its more than that you usually pay more

Not bad Unfortunately when I bought it Ms forgot to give the worms Maybe because the first buyer

It Crimea

coffee shop with a view of the train tracks in my opinion the price is relatively expensive when compared to the taste served

The taste was okay But i dont think its worth the price cause the portion was small
They have indoor and outdoor setting But the indoor was to dark and gloomy The only good thing was the outdoor cause you can see the train but you will absolutely cant use it if it were raining outside
They played the music out loud to the point of annoying I spend time to work there and have a meeting But they didnt even bother to decrease the volume
And dont forget the music wasnt suite the cafe vibes
And also lots of mosquito if you stay there past 5pm

Hope the cafe improve its quality vibes and service

The right place for bring the kid to see train Lovely vibes

Good

Actually in terms of location this cafe already has advantages  wins a lot But seen from several other sides there are a number of things that are a minus value

The positives the location is very strategic in the heart of the city  main wooden protocol road access  parking right on the edge of the main road From here its easy to go anywhere  surrounded by complete public facilities ATMs shops etc

What is inconvenient access from the 1st floor to the 3rd floor which is steep  not recommended for the elderly  children even teenagers have to be careful so they dont slip especially while carrying trays of coffee  snacks The view of the city from the balcony is also not optimal because it is blocked by cables  electricity poles which are very crowded

For variations in the price of drinks  snacks its not bad for a cafe in the city center area even though its still a bit burdensome for school childrens pockets Btw the delicious cheese bread makes you full  the chocolate ice is fresh
Maybe thats all for now hopefully in the future it will be even better 241222

this time I will tell you about my experience and what I feel after visiting this cafe The first time I visited this cafe with my junior high school friend in Malang he to be the one who told me about this place okay at that time we visited this place at 10 pm this place is still crowded it just so happens that this cafe has 3 floors the first floor is the cashier and also a few tables for visitors then on the 2nd floor is an indoor room where this room is covered with glass lots of tables and mostly used by students who want to do assignments because on the 2nd floor there is no smoking allowed so it is very comfortable to work in focus on the 2nd floor there is also a toilet whose design is very futuristic and of course interesting okay because at that time I sat on the 3rd floor there was a lively atmosphere lots of people hanging out with their friends because the rooftop on this floor allowed smoking there is also a bar here and there are lots of tables on the 3rd floor we can also see the city lights and the service at this cafe is quite good the employees are friendly but because the place is very busy it makes them a bit of a hassle

I just passed through Malang and so happen got tired and get some rest here The cappucino was meh it taste like instant coffee The ice cream was nice I buy kopyor ice cream and its decent for 15RB price Not so sweet just as I like it The place was spacious Lots of collage students there getting some work done Pretty cheap and cozy fast internet and clean I went to 3rd floor and since Malang is kinda cold that day its really nice Overall 710 Maybe after taste some dishes I could increase it Maybe next time

Cheap food and coffee wide and comfy dont use 3rd floor if it sunny too hot Okay when at night

WOW is one of the cafes located in Malng City With a very aesthetic location and suitable for doing tasks because of its convenient and cool location
There is also live music so we dont get bored to hang out there However  the prices there do not match student friendly  students and even boarding children like me with drinks priced above 20000 Because I think its expensive

it really tastes like this is the best boba anyway the price is not expensive but super delicious the best one is the original brown sugar Ive tried other flavors but its not great this is already delicious the cheese is ok the sweetness is just right instead of buying another brand which is already expensive 20 thousand and above its not worth it its better to just buy this

40 thousand buy 2 get 1 free cheap the boba is delicious its just that the packaging pays more attention because the order via Gofood spilled a bit 2 cups the original free one is also no less delicious than the taro boba the sweetness doesnt disappear even I just want to finish it its a shame coz the milk tastes fresh and delicious

Angkringan which is always crowded with young people hanging out

As for location pretty good according to the theme which is a place to hang out  some are sitting on the floor and some are sitting at table chairs Yesterday when I was here it suddenly rained soo a bit wet because the sandals also dripped water from the roof Supported by ambyar songs its getting better

For food its delicious Its just that yesterday when I ordered it wasnt very dry So theres no burnt appearance the impression is that its just warmed up for a while and also if you dont ask for seasoning dont add more seasoning Finally I asked the waitress to burn it until it was a little burnt Plus asking for spices So that the food tastes better

The best food here is SATE SKIN which is really the winner hehehee

 cafe with an industrial concept but the 2nd floor is really dim
 the ambience is suitable for those who like to work in cafes
 the drink menu is 11 12 concept b1g1 looks like kpsud but for larger sizes this swara anyway
 The taste is good even sweet in my opinion but its delicious so its not dominated by the bland taste of ice
 For this pizza I buy bread so you dont have to expect a lot for 20 thousand pizzas but its not bad either

Very industrial atmosphere
Good food fresh delicious ice
But its a shame that smoking is allowed here so its 1 with a place to eat its a bit uncomfortable with that

Come here want to try the drinks buy 1 get 1 free it turns out that its the same as the others 20k drinks get 1 coffee drink and 1 tea drink the taste is quite ordinary There is already a drink package on the menu if you buy drink A you will get free drink B but I dont know whether you can choose other than the package on the menu

Not bad for being a place to kill time while waiting for a movie to be watched at Moviemax Sarinah You can get a ticket to watch at night because  For seats on the outside smoking area you can get a view of the Malang city square and Ramayana 

Its my first time here Im quite disappointed Ordered crispy chicken tofu tempeh ginger and genbira soda half an hour of waiting was not finished It was great because there was a viewing schedule and the result was 30 minutes late watching total waiting for food to be cooked for 45 minutes maybe more Even drinking takes a long time not given at the beginning brg eat it Sorry for an honest review  Maybe the cooking staff is lacking or the ingredients have run out so they are forced the problem is when we ordered they also asked if the stock was still available or not 
About the standard taste because the price is quite cheap the size of a mall I hope it can be better and more crowded 

Clean not crowded comfortable can be indoor or outdoor so those who need a smoking area can really do it those who dont want to can also hang out comfortably inside
You can drink coffee eat snack or something else too if you want while you dont want to watch you can do that too
